A number of religions also satisfy for many the need of being linked with the ultimate and UNK Death is not permanent defeat and UNK man has a second chance. He is not lost in the abyss of endless time; he has endless being. Religion at its best also offers the experience of spiritual fulfillment by inviting man into the highest realm of the spirit. Religion can UNK UNK UNK and conserve all the highest ideals and values- UNK UNK and UNK of man formed in his culture. There is also the possibility, among higher religions, of experiencing consistent meaning in life and enjoying guidance and UNK The kind of religious experience that most UNK seek not only UNK UNK and relates human UNK values, ideals, and purposes; it also provides facilities and UNK for the development of personality, UNK and UNK Under the religious UNK whether UNK or UNK men have joy in UNK life leads UNK Religion at its best is out in front, ever UNK and leading on, and, as UNK put it, UNK all man's scattered energies in one UNK sense of his own infinite UNK At the same time that religion UNK the individual helpfully to the supernatural and gives him cosmic peace and a sense of supreme UNK it also has great therapeutic value for him. It gives him aid, comfort, even UNK in meeting mundane life situations where his own UNK practical knowledge and skill are felt by him to be inadequate. He is confronted with the recurrent UNK such as great natural catastrophes and the great transitions of life- marriage, UNK disease, UNK old age, the certainty of death. He has to cope with frustration and other emotional disturbance and UNK His religious beliefs provide him with plausible explanations for many conditions which cause him great concern, and his religious faith makes possible UNK UNK and UNK enabling him to endure UNK misfortune, fear, frustration, UNK suffering, evil, and danger. Religion usually also includes a principle of UNK mainly in a promised perfect future state. The belief in immortality, where held, functions as a UNK for the ills and UNK of the here and now. The tensions accompanying a UNK consciousness of UNK or UNK or some UNK secret are relieved for the less UNK or UNK by confession, UNK and UNK The feeling of individual UNK defeat, or UNK growing out of various social situations or individual deficiencies or failures is compensated for by communion in worship or prayer with a friendly, but UNK UNK as well as by sympathetic fellowship with others who share this faith, and by opportunities in religious acts for giving vent to emotions and UNK In providing for these inner individual functions, religion undertakes in behalf of individual peace of mind and well-being services for which there is no other institution. In addition to the functions of religion within man, there have always been the outer social functions for the community and society. The two have never been UNK Religion is vitally necessary in both societal maintenance and UNK The UNK of a community or society is always correlated with, and to a degree dependent upon, a more or less shared system of religious beliefs and convictions. The religion supports, UNK UNK and maintains the fundamental values. Even in the united states, with its freedom of religious belief and worship and its vast denominational UNK there is a general consensus regarding the basic Christian values. This is demonstrated especially when there is awareness of radically different value orientation UNK for example Americans rally to Christian values UNK those of UNK communism. In America also all of our major religious bodies officially sanction a UNK UNK which is reflective of our common religion. Even the UNK UNK the UNK marginal UNK and so on- have the values of Christian civilization UNK in them. Furthermore, religion tends to integrate the whole range of values from the highest or ultimate values of God to the UNK and subordinate values; for example, those regarding material objects and pragmatic ends. Finally, it gives UNK more than human UNK and even, through UNK reference, UNK and supernatural importance to some values; for example, marriage as a UNK much UNK as UNK occasionally the state as a divine instrument. It places certain values at least beyond questioning and UNK Closely related to this function is the fact that the religious system provides a body of ultimate ends for the society, which are compatible with the supreme eternal ends. This something leads to a conception of an over-all Social Plan with a meaning UNK in terms of ultimate UNK for example, a plan that UNK the will of God, which advances the Kingdom of God, which involves social life as part of the Grand UNK This explains some group ends and provides a justification of their UNK It gives social guidance and direction and makes for programs of social action. Finally, it gives meaning to much social UNK and logic, consistency, and meaning to life. In general, there is no society so secularized as to be completely without religiously inspired UNK ends. Religion UNK and UNK Some of the UNK most UNK and most cohesive forms of social groupings have grown out of religion. These groups have varied widely from mere families, UNK UNK groups, and small modern UNK and UNK to the UNK of great UNK and great, widely dispersed world UNK Religion fosters group life in various ways. The common ultimate values, ends and goals fostered by religion are a most important factor. Without a system of values there can be no society. Where such a value system prevails, it always UNK all who possess it; it enables members of the society to operate as a system. The beliefs of a religion also reflecting the values are expressed in UNK UNK and UNK and form what UNK calls a UNK As he points out, a religious group cannot exist without a collective credo, and the more extensive the credo, the more unified and strong is the group. The credo UNK and UNK men by UNK them completely to an identical body of UNK the more extensive and firm the body of doctrine, the firmer the group. The religious symbolism, and especially the closely related rites and worship forms, constitute a powerful bond for the members of the particular faith. The religion, in fact, is an expression of the unity of the group, small or large. The common codes, for religious action as such and in their ethical aspects for everyday moral behavior, bind the devotees together. These are ways of jointly participating in significantly UNK UNK and ordered religiously UNK behavior. The codes are mechanism for training in, and directing and UNK uniform social UNK and for continually and publicly UNK the solidarity of the group. UNK noted long ago that religion as "**h a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things **h UNK into one single moral community **h all those who adhere to them". His view is that every religion pertains to a community, and, conversely, every community is in one aspect a religious unit. This is brought out in the common religious ethos that prevails even in the UNK diverse audiences at many secular UNK and public occasions in the United UNK and it is evidenced in the prayers UNK in the frequent religious UNK and in the confirmation of points on religious grounds. The unifying effect of religion is also brought out in the fact that historically peoples have clung together as more or less cohesive cultural units, with religion as the dominant UNK even though UNK dispersed and not politically organized. The Jews for UNK years have been a prime example, though the adherents of any world or UNK religion are cases in point. it might be pointed out that the UNK function of religion, for good or UNK has often supported or been identified with other UNK political, UNK language, class, UNK UNK even economic. Religion usually exercises a UNK function. As such it acts as an anchor for the people. There is a marked tendency for religions, once firmly established, to resist change, not only in their own doctrines and policies and practices, but also in secular affairs having religious UNK It has thus been a significant factor in the conservation of social values, though also in some measure, an obstacle to the creation or diffusion of new ones. It tends to support the longstanding precious UNK the traditional ways of thinking, and the customary ways of living. As UNK has pointed out, the "**h reliance on symbols, on tradition, on sacred writings, on the cultivation of emotional feelings of identity and harmony with sacred values, turns one to the past far more than to the future". Historically, religion has also UNK as a tremendous engine of UNK UNK UNK and UNK of various other institutions. At the same time that religion exercises a UNK influence, it also UNK and motivates both individuals and groups. Much of the important individual and social action has been UNK to religious UNK The great ultimate ends of religion have served as magnificent beacon lights that lured people toward them with an almost irresistible force, UNK energies and inducing UNK for example, the UNK mission efforts, just wars. Much effort has been expended in the sincere effort to apply the teaching and admonitions of religion. The UNK reward systems that most religions UNK have great motivating effects. Religion provides the most attractive UNK either in this world or the next, for those who not merely abide by its UNK but who engage in good works. Religion usually acts as a powerful aid in social control, enforcing what men should or should not do. Among primitive peoples the sanctions and dictates of religion were more binding than any of the other controls exercised by the UNK and in modern societies such influence is still great. Religion has its own supernatural UNK that are at the same time codes of behavior for the here and now. UNK with the care of five young children and concerned about persistent economic difficulties due to her husband's marginal income, her defense of denial was UNK strong. Thus the lack of effective recognition of the responsibilities involved in caring for two babies showed signs of becoming a disabling problem. The result, dramatically visible in a matter of days in the family's disrupted daily UNK was a UNK fear that some terrible harm would UNK the second UNK whose birth had not been anticipated. Soon Mrs& UNK fears threatened to burst into a UNK panic concerning the welfare of the entire family. UNK to care for the other children, difficulty in feeding the UNK who seemed UNK UNK UNK repeated crying UNK and short UNK reflected the family's helplessness in coping with the UNK situation. Clearly, this was a family in crisis. Mrs& B& compared her feelings of weakness to her feelings of weakness and helplessness at the time of her mother's death when she was UNK as well as her subsequent anger at her father for UNK Her previous UNK experiences flashed through her mind as if they had happened yesterday. On the anniversary of her father's death she poured out with UNK tears her feelings of guilt about not having attended his funeral. In the family's own words UNK the third of twelve UNK they had UNK the crisis UNK either the situation will give or we will UNK Direct confrontation and acceptance of Mrs& UNK anger against the second baby soon UNK her fears of UNK UNK of her anxiety and guilt concerning the death of her parents, when linked up with her current feelings of anger and her fears of loss, UNK and UNK produced further relief of tension. In a joint interview Mr& and Mrs& B& were helped to understand the meaning of a younger son's wandering away from home in terms of his feelings of displacement in reaction to the arrival of the UNK The father, accurately UNK the child's needs, not only respected them as worthy of his attention, but immediately satisfied them by taking him on his lap along with the UNK saying, "I have a big lap; there is room for you, too, UNK Simultaneously, a variety of environmental UNK a calm but not too UNK UNK referral for temporary economic aid, intelligent use of nursing care, accompaniment to the UNK clinic for medical advice on the UNK feeding problem- combined to prevent further development of predictable pathological UNK UNK visits of the nurse and social worker indicated continued success in the care of the new babies as well as a marked improvement in the family's day-to-day mental health and social functioning. As seen in the B& family, there must be an attempt to help the client develop conscious awareness of the problem, especially in the absence of a formal request for assistance. The lack of awareness usually springs from deep but disguised anxiety, often assuming the superficial guise of "not UNK or "not UNK The unhealthy use of denial in the initial reaction to a stress must be handled through the medium of a positive controlled UNK In general, the approach is more active than passive, more UNK than UNK While some regression is UNK it is discouraged rather than encouraged so that the UNK does not follow the stages of planned regression associated with certain casework adaptations of the psychoanalytic model for insight therapy. To establish an emotionally meaningful relationship the worker must demonstrate actual or potential UNK UNK preferably within the first interview, by meeting the client's specific needs. These needs usually concern the reduction of guilt and some relief of tension. The initial interview must be therapeutic rather than purely exploratory in an UNK sense. In this UNK stage the worker must communicate confidence in the client's ability to deal with the problem. In so doing he implicitly offers the positive UNK of hope as a kind of UNK dynamic to counteract feelings of helplessness and hopelessness generally associated with the first stages of stress impact. Thus, the client receives enough ego support to engage in constructive efforts on his own UNK Here there is a specific preventive component which applies in a more generalized sense to any casework situation. We are preventing or averting UNK phenomena such as undue UNK unhealthy suppression and UNK excessive use of UNK and UNK guilt turned against the self. While some suppression and some denial are not only necessary but healthy, the worker's clinical knowledge must determine how these defenses are being used, what healthy shifts in defensive adaptation are indicated, and when efforts at bringing about change can be most effectively UNK In steering the family toward UNK and away from UNK UNK the worker uses UNK focused casework techniques of specific emotional support, UNK and UNK guidance. Over a relatively short period of time, usually about four to twelve weeks, the worker must be able to shift the focus, back and forth, between immediate external UNK UNK UNK UNK and the key, emotionally relevant issues UNK UNK which are, often in a dramatic UNK UNK UNK by the crisis situation, and hence once again amenable to resolution. Though there is obviously nothing new about these techniques, they do challenge the worker's skill to articulate them precisely on the spot and on the basis of quick and accurate diagnostic UNK Then, too, the utmost clinical flexibility is necessary in UNK combining carefully timed UNK home UNK single and group office interviews, and appropriate telephone follow-up calls, if the worker is to be genuinely accessible and if the predicted unhealthy outcome is to be actually UNK in accordance with the principles of preventive intervention. In addition, in many cases, a variety of concrete social UNK UNK day care, medical and financial UNK must be reasonably available for the reality support needed to UNK the family in its individual and collective coping and UNK efforts. At certain critical stages, and only for sound diagnostic reasons, it may be important to accompany family members in their use of these resources if their UNK behavior is to be constructive rather than UNK While expensive in time and involving a great deal of adaptation on the part of the worker (in terms of his willingness to leave the UNK of his office and enter actively into the client's UNK techniques of accompaniment were found to be of tremendous value when in the service of specific preventive objectives. Finally, whatever the techniques used, a twin goal is common to all preventive casework UNK to cushion or reduce the force of the stress impact while at the same time to encourage and support family members to UNK and use their ego UNK Having outlined an approach to the theory and practice of preventive UNK we now address ourselves to our final question: What place should brief, UNK preventive casework occupy in our total spectrum of UNK We should first recognize our tendency to develop a hierarchy of values, locating brief treatment at the bottom and long-term intensive service at the top, instead of seeing the services as part of a UNK each important in its own right. This problem is perhaps as old as social casework itself. Almost three decades ago Bertha Reynolds undertook a study of UNK interviewing because of her conviction that short-term casework had an important but neglected place in our network of social services. Her conclusion has been borne out in the experience of many UNK "**h UNK interviewing is neither a UNK nor a UNK experience but is of the same essential quality as the so-called intensive case work". Thus, casework involving a limited number of interviews is still to be regarded in terms of the quality of service rendered rather than of the quantity of time UNK That we are experiencing an upsurge of interest in the many formulations and preventive adaptations of brief treatment in social casework is evident from even a small sampling of current literature. Especially noteworthy is UNK finding that the length of treatment per UNK is not a reliable indicator of successful UNK According to a number of studies, the important UNK are the nature and management of the client's anxiety as well as the UNK of the helping person. For example, the level of improvement noted in a recent experiment with a short course of immediate treatment for UNK relationship problems compared favorably with the results reported by typical child guidance UNK where the hours spent in purely diagnostic study may equal or exceed the number of hours devoted to actual treatment interviews in the experimental project. Of startling significance, too, is the assertion that it was possible to carry out this program with only a 6 percent attrition rate as compared with a rate of UNK percent reported for a comparable group of families who were receiving help in traditionally operated child guidance services. These reports refer to a level of secondary prevention in a child guidance clinic approached by the customary route of voluntary referral by the family or by other professional people. UNK to the approach which I have described are evident in the prompt establishment of a helping relationship, quick appraisal of key issues, and the immediate UNK of treatment plans as the essential dynamics in helping to further the UNK coping efforts in dealing with the interplay of inner and outer UNK While there are many different possibilities for the timing of casework UNK the experiments recently reported from a variety of traditional settings all point up the importance of an UNK response to the client's initial need for help. In some programs, treatment is concentrated over a short period of time, while in others, after the initial contact is established, flexible spacing of interviews has been experimentally used with apparent success. UNK to take the risk of early and direct interpretation (with the UNK that if the interpretation is too threatening, the worker can UNK is another prominent feature in these efforts. My aim in mentioning this factor obviously is not to give license to UNK UNK but rather to encourage us to use the UNK clinical casework skills we already UNK and to use them with greater confidence, UNK and professional UNK Though there is obviously great need for continued experimentation with various types of short-term intervention to further efforts in developing an operational definition of prevention at the UNK or perhaps, in some instances, UNK level, the place of short-term intervention has already been documented by a number of investigators in a wide variety of settings. UNK for example, has emphasized the UNK for a broad spectrum of services, including very brief services in connection with critical UNK Ideally, brief treatment should be arrived at as a treatment of choice rather than as a treatment of chance. Moreover, the shortage of treatment resources and the UNK persistent shortage of mental health manpower force us to UNK additional refinements of preventive intervention techniques to make services more widely UNK and on a more effective basis to more people. Further research in the meaning of crises as experienced by the consumers of traditional social casework services- including attempts to develop a UNK of family structures, crisis problems, reaction UNK and differential treatment UNK and the establishment of new experimental programs are imperative social needs which should command the best efforts of UNK in collaboration with community UNK our literature is already UNK with a fantastic number of suggestions for preventive agency programming ranging from the immediately practical to the UNK UNK UNK in the immediate future, we will have to settle for UNK efforts that fall short of utopian models. UNK experimentation with UNK agencies, especially those that combine UNK the traditional functions of family and child welfare services, holds rich promise for the future. For example, child welfare experience UNK with cases in which the UNK request for substitute care is precipitated by a crisis event which is UNK linked with a fundamental UNK problem of family relationships. UNK UNK management and communication of sentiment are the processes involved in the functioning of the element of sentiment or feeling. One of the devices for tension management is preferential UNK The preferential mating of this particular population has been analyzed in a separate study. The relative geographical isolation of the Brandywine population makes for a limited choice in UNK It would seem necessary that members of this population provide support for one another since it is not provided by the larger society. The supportive relations can apparently be achieved in geographical and social isolation. The UNK building homes on the same land with either set of parents, and the almost exclusive use of members of the population as sponsors for UNK and UNK illustrate this supportive relationship. As Loomis remarks, "In the internal pattern the chief reason for UNK is to communicate liking, friendship, and love among those who stand in supporting relations to one another and corresponding negative sentiments to those who stand in antagonistic UNK UNK Maintenance of the <status UNK might seem to be the appropriate goal or objective of this population today. Yet, the object of the element of achieving through the process of goal attaining for this population appears to have been changed by circumstances brought about by the war. Prior to World War /2, there was a higher percentage of UNK marriages than after World war /2,. UNK The UNK as elements, refer to "all criteria for judging the character or conduct of both individual and group actions in any social UNK The process of evaluation assigns varying positive and negative priorities or values to elements. The elements and processes become evident in a study of mate selection in this population. From the evidence "it may be UNK that UNK marriages are the preferred unions for core males and UNK UNK marriages still belong in the category of permissive UNK and core-Negro marriages are UNK for core UNK UNK The element of UNK and associated processes have not been sufficiently investigated for this population to permit any type of UNK about them. UNK There is some indication from a limited number of interviews with members of the population that the element of power, primarily the voluntary influence of UNK power, has been exerted on actors in the system, particularly in regard to mate selection. This would seem to vary from family to family, depending somewhat on the core or marginal UNK of that family. Again, size of the group may have some influence on the strength of group controls. UNK UNK with members of the Brandywine population were attempted in order to discover the ranking of the various families in the population. The large majority of the UNK placed core families in the upper positions. Loomis considers ranking a product of the evaluation process. "The standing or rank of an actor in a given social system is determined by the evaluation placed upon the actor and his acts in accordance with the norms and standards of the UNK Despite the increasing rate of UNK marriages, the population has been able to UNK at least to some degree, the consciousness of its intermediate status in society. To some extent the system can be considered a UNK in which UNK UNK are determined by birth, by attributes such as sex or UNK which are UNK or socially UNK The adherence of many in the population to the Indian background in their UNK and emphasis upon the fact that their UNK had never been slaves, becomes of prime interest in determining how far these elements promote the UNK of the intermediate status of the group in society. UNK The negative sanctions applied to core-Negro marriages for core members act as indicators of expected adherence to group norms. However, because of Church laws, lately more UNK UNK which UNK the marriage of cousins closely related UNK a means of UNK the goal of UNK relations may be that of recourse to UNK unions. A cursory survey of available material indicates a high rate of UNK UNK occurring to parents who have a close UNK relationship. UNK The comprehensive or master processes UNK all or some of the elements within the social system and subsystems. Within the larger social system are the structural and functional subsystems. The structural UNK consisting of relatively stable UNK among its parts, UNK _1._ UNK of various types, UNK by UNK norms. _2._ UNK of various types, within the larger system and within the subgroups **h _3._ UNK norms governing subgroups and roles. _4._ Cultural values. In the study of marriage patterns for this group, UNK produces the structural system- a system of UNK which, in turn, maintains the system of UNK UNK of various types have been found within this system. Each family line can be considered a UNK There seems to be an implied cultural value attached to the fact of core status within the group. UNK the proscription of core-Negro marriages for core families, discussed above, would seem to act as a UNK norm governing subgroups and roles. The scope of this study does not provide for the study of roles of various types within the larger system or within the UNK However, it cannot be UNK informal though the structure of the population seems, that there are not well-defined roles within the system. The present study relates to the theory of functional systems. It is UNK that fertility is a function of the social system when the population as a whole is considered and a function of the subsystems when the UNK division of core families and marginal families is considered. The four functional problems of a social system are, to some extent, solved by the subsystems within this population. By means of geographical isolation and high fertility rates, UNK can be fostered and the pattern of isolation from the greater society maintained. In order to attain the goal of group solidarity and to relieve tension, the high fertility rate provides more group members for mate selection, and the UNK of members in groups fosters acceptance of group controls. To maintain their intermediate position in the larger society, it is not only necessary that members of this population be UNK but that their numbers be great enough to be recognized as a UNK distinct grouping or system in society. As mentioned above, where families are concentrated in larger numbers, group controls seem strongest and most effective. UNK to the social and UNK environment through the economy has been met to a degree through a type of occupational segregation. This provides the necessary contact with the larger society, while supporting a type of control over members in terms of social contacts. UNK "has to do with the UNK of UNK The problem of solidarity and morale again involves the concept of values. The values placed by the Brandywine population, upon maintaining a certain UNK a certain separate racial identity, and therefore a certain separate social status, are important for the morale of the system. Since morale is closely related to pattern maintenance and integration, the higher the morale and UNK the better the system can solve the problems of the system. In this respect it would seem that the greater the social distance between the Brandywine population and the white and Negro populations within the same general UNK the greater the possibility for higher morale and solidarity within the Brandywine population. It is conceived that one of the means to attain this social distance is that of physical and social isolation. In turn, higher fertility rates for this population provide a means of increasing the numerical quantity of the population, allowing for the possibility of greater stability and unity. The population can thereby replenish itself and actually grow larger. UNK UNK Of particular utility in the analysis of the development, UNK and change of social systems has been the use of the master or comprehensive processes. Loomis considers six such processes in his UNK 1. UNK 2. UNK maintenance 3. UNK UNK 4. UNK 5. Social control 6. UNK Though undoubtedly all six processes are operative within the whole social system and its UNK two processes that are of crucial importance to this study will be singled out for particular UNK UNK In discussing the process of communication, Loomis defines it as "the process by which information, decisions, and UNK are transmitted among actors and the ways in which knowledge, opinions, and attitudes are formed, or modified by UNK UNK may be UNK by means of the high visibility within the larger community. UNK interaction is easier where segregated living and occupational segregation mark off a group from the rest of the community, as in the case of this population. However, the factor of physical isolation is not a static situation. Although the Brandywine population is still predominantly UNK "there are indications of a consistent and a UNK significant trend away from the older and relatively isolated rural communities **h urbanization appears to be an important factor in the UNK of this group. This conclusion is, however, an UNK A more realistic analysis must take into account the fact that Brandywine people in the UNK area are, in general, less segregated locally than group members in rural areas. In the urban area, in other words, they, unlike some urban ethnic groups, do not concentrate in ghetto UNK Group pressures toward conformity are slight or UNK and UNK behavior in mate selection UNK few if any social UNK In such a setting social contacts and associations are likely to be UNK resulting in a change of values and almost UNK in mate selection behavior. To the extent that urban life contributes to the breakdown of the group patterns of residential UNK to that extent it contributes directly to increased UNK UNK UNK The process of social control is operative insofar as sanctions play a part in the individual's behavior, as well as the UNK behavior. By means of this social control, UNK is either eliminated or somehow made compatible with the function of the social group. Examples from this population indicate that UNK seems to be sanctioned by UNK from the group. UNK There is an oral tradition among the members of the population in regard to the origin and subsequent separate status of the group in the larger society. UNK and divided though this tradition may be, it is an important part of the social and cultural heritage of the group, and acts as a means of UNK particularly for members of the rural community. The fact of Indian ancestry and UNK status during the days of slavery, are important distinctions made by members of the group. UNK UNK UNK induced social cohesion resulting from common norms and values UNK by members of the group" is operative in the boundary maintenance of the group as well as in the process of UNK The process of boundary maintenance identifies and preserves the social system or UNK and the characteristic interaction is maintained. As the threat of encroachment on the system increases, the UNK of applied boundary maintenance mechanisms UNK The fertility rate pattern would seem to be a function, though a latent one, of the process of maintaining the UNK UNK boundary maintenance may be achieved, for example, by assigning a higher primacy or evaluation to activities characteristic of the external pattern **h" The external pattern or external system can be considered as UNK behavior that enables the group to survive in its environment **h" UNK maintenance for this group would seem to be primarily social, as is the preference for UNK It is also expressed in the proscription against UNK in the matter of UNK particularly in rural areas. By their pattern of UNK and UNK the core families and the marginal families show distinct limits to the UNK contact they UNK UNK UNK Where boundary maintenance describes the boundaries or limits of the group, UNK UNK is defined "as the process whereby one or more of the elements of at least two social systems is UNK in such a manner that the two systems in some ways and on some occasions may be viewed as a single unit. A royal decree issued in 1910, two years after the Belgian government assumed authority for the administration of the Congo, prescribed the registration of all adult males by UNK Further decrees along this line were issued in 1916 and UNK In 1922 a continuous registration of the whole indigenous population was instituted by ordinance of the UNK and the periodic compilation of these records was UNK But specific procedures for carrying out this plan were left to the discretion of the provincial UNK A unified set of regulations, applicable to all areas, was issued in 1929, and a complementary series of demographic inquiries in selected areas was instituted at the same time. The whole system was again reviewed and reorganized in UNK General responsibility for its administration rested with a division of the colonial government concerned with labor supply and native affairs, Service des UNK UNK et de la UNK UNK **f UNK **f UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK authorities, the UNK and their UNK were held responsible for maintaining the registers of indigenous persons within their territories, under the general supervision of district officials. The district officials, along with their other duties, were obliged to organize special demographic inquiries in selected areas and to supervise the annual UNK of demographic statistics. The regulations require the UNK of each individual UNK or female, adult or UNK on a separate card UNK The cards, filed by UNK UNK or UNK are kept in the headquarters of each UNK UNK Each card is expected to show certain information about the individual concerned, including his or her date of birth (or age at a specified UNK UNK and children. Additional entries must be made from time to time. Different cards are used for males and UNK and a corner is UNK from the cards of adults, and of children when they reach UNK So a quick count could be made at any time, even by an illiterate clerk, of the number of registered persons in four UNK classes. Personal identification cards are issued to all adult males on which tax payments, UNK periods of employment, and changes of residence are recorded. Similar identification cards were issued in 1959 to all adult females. Each adult is held personally responsible for assuring his UNK and obtaining an identification card which must be shown on demand. The registration card of a person leaving his home territory for a short period is put into a special file for absent persons. The cards of permanent UNK are, in theory, sent to an office in the place of new UNK Finally, the registration of UNK and deaths by nearest relatives was made compulsory in most regions. Numbers of registered persons in four UNK classes were counted each year. In addition, demographic UNK supposedly involving field investigations, were conducted in selected minor divisions UNK containing about 3 percent of the total population. The results of these inquiries were used to adjust UNK of data from the registers and to provide various ratios and rates by districts, including birth and death rates, general fertility rates, distributions by marital status, fertility of wives separately in UNK and UNK UNK infant mortality, and UNK The areas to be examined in these inquiries were selected by local officials, supposedly as representative of a larger population. UNK of the ratios obtained in a few selected areas were applied to the larger population. The scheme, in theory, is an ingenious adaptation of European registration systems to the conditions of African life. But it places a severe strain on the administrative resources UNK burdened in other UNK of a widely UNK poor and largely illiterate population. The sampling program was instituted before the principles of probability sampling were widely recognized in population studies. The system was not well adapted to conditions of life in urban centers. The distinction between UNK UNK UNK and present UNK UNK population was not clearly defined. So the results are subject to considerable confusion. The system tended to break down during the war, but was UNK it had reached the pre-war level of efficiency by 1951. In spite of the defects in this system, the figures on total population during the late 1930's and again in the early UNK seem to have represented actual conditions in most districts with approximate UNK But the information on the dynamics of population was often quite misleading. The same system, with minor UNK was developed in Ruanda-Urundi under Belgian administration. Here again it seems that useful UNK of the size and geographical distribution of the population were obtained in this way in the late pre-war and early post-war periods. Before considering more recent activities, we should note another important aspect of UNK in Belgian Africa. A number of strong independent agencies, established in some cases with governmental or royal support, have conducted large medical, social, educational and research operations in particular parts of the Congo and UNK The work of UNK UNK Elisabeth pour UNK UNK UNK UNK du Congo UNK UNK has special interest with respect to UNK This agency accepted responsibility for medical services to a population ranging from UNK persons in 1941 to UNK in 1956 in the UNK District and adjacent areas east of UNK Each year from 1941 on, its medical staff had conducted intensive field investigations to determine changes in population structure and vital rates and, as its primary objective, the incidence of major diseases. Its findings are reported each year in its UNK sur UNK UNK UNK **h UNK Somewhat similar investigations have been made by medical officers in other areas. Other independent, or partially independent agencies, have promoted investigations on topics directly or indirectly related to UNK These studies vary widely in scope and precision. UNK pour la UNK UNK en UNK UNK UNK has sponsored UNK field investigations and has UNK closely with the government of Ruanda-Urundi in the development of its official statistics. A massive investigation of the characteristics of UNK and prospective UNK in Ruanda-Urundi is being carried on by J& J& UNK former Director of the Social Science branch of UNK now a professor at UNK UNK du Congo UNK et du UNK Some 30,000 completed schedules with 20 items UNK by UNK in UNK UNK have been UNK The results are now being analyzed. UNK have been recognized as a matter of strategic importance in the Congo and in Ruanda-Urundi during the post-war years in connection with long-term economic and social programs. The ~AIMO organizations of both countries, which maintain administrative services throughout the territories, retained immediate responsibility for the collection and publication of demographic information. However, the statistical offices of both governments were assigned responsibility for the planning and analysis of these statistics. A Bureau de la UNK UNK UNK UNK was formed under ~AIMO in the Congo, to work in close rapport with the Section UNK of the Secretariat General. Eventually responsibility for demographic inquiries in the Congo was transferred to the demographic division of the Central UNK Office. The 1952 demographic inquiry in Ruanda-Urundi was directed by V& UNK a member of the UNK staff, though the inquiry was carried out under the auspices of UNK which has continuing responsibility for demographic statistics in this territory. A member of the UNK staff (E& van de UNK was recently delegated to cooperate with ~AIMO in the development of demographic statistics in this territory. The initiation of sampling UNK in Ruanda-Urundi UNK and in the Congo UNK were major UNK We will deal first with the program in the Congo though this was put into operation later than the other. The radical nature of the innovation in the Congo was not emphasized in the official UNK The term UNK UNK previously used for the supplementary investigations carried out in connection with the administrative UNK was used for the new investigations. However, the differences in procedure are UNK These are as follows: UNK UNK WORK UNK Field operations were transferred from administrative personnel primarily engaged in other tasks to specially trained teams of full-time African investigators (three UNK each working in two UNK These teams carried out the same operations UNK in different areas. UNK UNK OF THE UNK Sample areas in the new investigations were selected strictly by application of the principles of probability theory, so as to be representative of the total population of defined areas within UNK limits. In short, scientific sampling was introduced in place of subjective UNK The populations of the various districts, or other major divisions, were UNK by type of community UNK UNK UNK and, where UNK by ethnic UNK and by type of economy. Sample units UNK in rural areas, houses in UNK were drawn systematically within these UNK UNK UNK OF THE UNK Different sampling ratios were applied under different conditions. Higher proportions were sampled in urban and mixed communities than in rural areas. About 11 percent of the total population was covered in the new investigation, as compared with about 3 percent in the previous inquiries. UNK UNK AND UNK UNK questions, UNK and procedures were enforced throughout the whole country. Data were obtained, UNK on three classes of UNK (a) residents, present; (b) residents, UNK and (c) visitors. In the reports, summary results are given for both the <de facto> (a and UNK and <de UNK (a and UNK UNK but the subsequent analysis of characteristics is reported only for the <de UNK population (or, in some districts, only the <de facto> UNK These changes represent in effect, a shift from (1) an administrative compilation of data obtained through procedures designed primarily to serve political and economic objectives to (2) a systematic sampling census of the whole African population. The population registration system still has important functions. It supplies local data which are useful in administration and which can be used as a basis for intensive studies in particular situations. It provides a frame for the sampling census. It also provides a frame within which the registration of vital events is gradually gaining force (though one cannot expect to obtain reliable vital statistics in most parts of the Congo from this source in the near UNK It is still used in making current population estimates in UNK years, though the value of these estimates is open to question. Finally, it may have certain very important, less obvious values. Even though the registers may have an incomplete record of persons present in a particular area or include persons no longer living there, they contain precise information on ages, by date of birth, for some of the persons present UNK children in relatively stable UNK and supplementary information (such as records of marital UNK for many others. The quality of the census data can, therefore, be greatly improved by the use of the registration records in conjunction with the field inquiries. Furthermore, it may be possible to estimate the error due to bias in method (as distinguished from sampling UNK in each of these sources, on such subjects as UNK mortality, and migration during a given interval by using information from two largely independent sources in UNK The first sampling census in the Congo extended over a three-year period, UNK the results were still being processed in 1959. It is planned to double the number of teams and to make use of improved equipment in a second demographic inquiry in 1960, so that the inquiry can be carried through in one year and the results published more UNK It is proposed that in the future complete sampling UNK be carried out at five-year intervals. Reports already issued on the sampling UNK UNK in various areas run as follows UNK only the French and omitting corresponding Flemish UNK UNK This report contains preliminary notes and 35 tables. Other reports in identical form, but with somewhat varying content, have been issued for: UNK These area reports will be followed, according to present plans, by a summary report, which will include a detailed statement on methods. With this evidence in mind, the writer began to plan how he might more effectively educate the married students in his functional classes. UNK the end of the UNK work, he interviewed every married class member at great length. He found, as he had UNK a general consensus that perhaps over half of the present functionally designed course was not really functional for these students. However, all admitted that the "hind sight" was not altogether lost. In their own words, it had aided them to get a clearer picture of how they had gotten into their marriages, and perhaps they had obtained some insights on why certain troubles appeared from time to time. In fact, they went so far as to caution the writer that if he attempted to design a section UNK for married students there should be, at the beginning, some "hind sight" UNK but they all hastened to add that certainly less time was needed on it than presently UNK All of them felt a compelling need for more coverage on areas that could be only lightly touched upon in a general survey functional course. A few were doubtful about the merits of an exclusive section for married students. As one of them expressed it, "It has done me a world of good to listen to the nai^ve questions and comments of these UNK people. I can now better see just what processes provoked certain actions from me in the past. Had I been in an UNK section I would have missed this, and I believe that this single aspect has been of great personal value to me". This comment and others similar to it, would seem to indicate a possible justification for continuing the status UNK But the weight of feeling was heavily in the opposite direction. Thus, the writer decided to hold one experimental section of the functional preparation for marriage course in the spring semester of 1960 exclusively for persons already UNK that is, UNK UNK This did not mean that married students could not enroll in other UNK sections, and some of them, largely because of UNK difficulties, did. But only those already married could enroll in this one section. In addition, two other differences in the two types of sections must be noted. 1) The regular sections do not allow UNK this one did. This action was UNK on the basis of a small survey which indicated that a high percentage of married UNK women on our campus never become UNK Many of them appear to drop out, for one reason or another. By permitting freshman students we might extend the opportunity for such a course to some individuals who otherwise might never get to take it. This has subsequently been verified by the experience. 2) UNK were encouraged. In the regular sections they have always been more or less discouraged. The philosophy has been that if they could find the time to attend class why not encourage them to get the credit and perhaps provide an incentive to do the work more UNK Besides, UNK do not count on faculty load with the same weight as regularly enrolled students. But in this one section we welcomed UNK Why? For no particular reason, other than that the writer felt it might- just might- encourage both mates to be in UNK Many of the men on our campus have a pretty set curriculum, especially in the various engineering fields, with few UNK till the senior year. Incidentally, it needs to be noted that because UNK were permitted the section began increasing in numbers each week, until at last it UNK to such proportions that this UNK UNK policy had to be UNK After that, we began to get UNK to class. This experimental class represented quite a variety of students. It ranged from a freshman woman, just married, through the various academic growth stages, including one UNK student, to a young faculty member recently married to a senior man who also attended. It ranged from those with no children, through students in various stages of UNK to one 44-year-old male with four children, three of whom were UNK It ranged from two women members who had experienced premarital UNK to one couple twelve years married and seemingly unable to UNK One might UNK at this point and speculate that if it is UNK to create special sections for special status, then why not a special section for women pregnant before marriage, and one for 44-year-old men with teenage children, and so on. Some of these speculations may have some merit, others are somewhat UNK But few who have experienced marriage can dispute the fact that the focus of UNK relationships is different UNK marriage than in a UNK situation. The writer began this special class by explaining his background thinking for creating such a section in the first place. He made it clear from the beginning that this was the UNK opportunity, and that the future destiny of such groups depended on favorable results from this one. He UNK build a framework of academic UNK and one which did not UNK upon the UNK UNK of any other existing campus course. This is to say that this was not a course in wise buying or money spending methods, nor a course in how to raise children. We already have courses covering those problems, and so on. But within that framework he allowed for as much flexibility as possible. A steering committee of students was organized on the first day whose duty it was to be alert and constantly evaluate and UNK the direction and UNK the class was UNK The writer, being UNK through his interviews of the reactions of previous married students, did insist on there being included some "hind sight" material. But the greater part of semester time was actually centered around the attitudes "So we are UNK now how do we make the best of it"? or "How do we UNK our already fine UNK UNK were used, as with all sections, but with one big difference. Our campus, unfortunately, owns no films. Since they are all either rented or UNK the requested dates for their use have to be far in advance. The writer never knew from week to week just where the section might be. For example, the steering committee might announce that the group felt a topic under study should not be dropped for an additional week as there was still too much of it untouched. Since the writer had established this democratic procedure in the beginning he had to go along with their UNK UNK of course, pointing out whether he thought their decision was a wise or an unwise one. Thus the films seen as they came in UNK for the regular UNK were often out of context. Nevertheless, the writer has never experienced such spontaneity of discussion after film UNK Though it did not become known to the writer for some time, a nucleus group had sprung up within the class. They began to meet in the evenings and carry forward various discussions they felt not fully enough covered in class. From a few students this group gradually increased to include over UNK of those officially enrolled in the class, and many UNK as well. Also, although only a few of the students were intimately acquainted with each other in the beginning, most reported that when the semester ended their UNK and closest campus UNK were with members of that class. In fact, they often UNK their social activities to include class members previously unknown. UNK outside reading reports were handled just as in the other sections, the major difference being that there was a UNK UNK UNK in the reported outside reading by the married group. These students, although they might read various articles in popular magazines, more often chose to report on articles found in the UNK In addition to the noticeable difference in outside articles, there was a considerable difference in the outside books they read. Whereas a high per cent of the regular students can be expected to read other UNK which more or less plow the same ground in a little different direction, the married students chose whole books on specific areas and went into much greater detail in their areas of interest. Since the writer had not noticed this characteristic in married students scattered throughout the various sections previous to this experiment, UNK as a matter of fact, in those who were continuing in UNK UNK he can only conclude that there must have been something UNK within the specific group which caused this to occur. In the main, this course took the following directional high UNK 1) A great deal of time was spent on UNK for solving marital differences. This was not a search for a UNK UNK but rather an examination of basic principles pertaining especially to all types of communication in marriage. In short, it was centered around learning how to develop a UNK sensitive UNK Not until the group was satisfied in this area were they willing to venture further to 2) Specific adjustment areas, such as sex, UNK religion, finance, and so on. From here they proceeded to UNK These same areas in relation to their own future family life stages, developing these to the extent of examining various crises which could be expected to confront them at some time or other. As an example of this last UNK there were some lengthy discussions centered around UNK UNK these were concerned with the possibility of the death of one parent and the complication of living with the UNK UNK but the possible death of one's own UNK was not UNK Since the course, one member has lost her husband. This was not a particularly shocking or unexpected thing- it was previously known to her that it might happen. But just when was an UNK and of course the longer it did not happen, the stronger her wish and belief that it might not. Since her UNK this individual has reported to the writer on numerous occasions about how helpful the class discussions were to her in this adjustment crisis. Quite frequently class members brought questions from their mates at home. These were often carefully written out with a great deal of thought behind them. This added a personal zest to class discussions and participation. Both sexes reported that the discussions on sex adjustment within marriage were extremely UNK The writer sensed a much freer and more frank discussion, especially of this one area, than ever before. He felt certain for the first time in his teaching experience that the men in the class understood that UNK as a UNK is not nearly so essential for a satisfying female sexual experience as most males might UNK This was probably much more meaningful because all the women in the class emphasized it time and again. On the other hand, the women class members appeared to reach a far greater understanding than have women members in other sections that it is more natural for males as a group to view sex as sex rather than always UNK it with love as most women seem to do. in the UNK area it could be readily observed that all felt freer to discuss things than students had previously in UNK marital status sections. Perhaps this was related to the fact that all were in on it to some extent. Never in other sections has there been the opportunity for the genuine down-to-earth discussions about the feelings of both UNK during various stages of UNK There was a particularly marvelous opportunity for study in this area since almost every stage of UNK was represented, from a UNK couple to and including every UNK In fact, we had one birth before the end of the course, and another student had to take the final UNK a week early, just to be on the safe side. There was also one spontaneous UNK during the semester. Thus it is reasonable to believe that there is a significant difference between the two groups in their performance on this task after a brief UNK experience. It was predicted that Kohnstamm-negative subjects would adhere to more liberal, UNK reports of what the ambiguous figure UNK UNK as reflecting their UNK about taking chances. This was true mostly of those Kohnstamm-negative subjects who did not perceive the ambiguous figure as people in action. UNK such as UNK with a loop in it", and "two pieces of UNK were quite characteristic. UNK UNK UNK The three personality inventories UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK were filled out by 12 of the Kohnstamm-positive subjects and 19 of the Kohnstamm-negative subjects. These were the same subjects who were given the UNK test. Some UNK had been made concerning factors UNK UNK ~I and UNK on these inventories which appeared to be directly related to control and security aspects of personality functioning which were UNK as being of importance in differential Kohnstamm reactivity. Only UNK differentiated between the two groups at less that the 5% level (**f). One prediction had been made about the difference in security or UNK between those subjects who shifted their Kohnstamm reactivity when informed and those who did not. The UNK had been separated into two groups on this assumption with the presumably UNK UNK and UNK reactors being used as the groups for comparative personality studies. It was predicted that those who shifted in their Kohnstamm reactivity would differ significantly from those who did not on the factor ~I which the investigators refer to as the UNK factor. All of the subjects in the Kohnstamm-negative and Kohnstamm-positive groups (as defined for purposes of the personality UNK were compared with those subjects who shifted in UNK /3, or /4,. A UNK test on these two groups, UNK vs& UNK gave a UNK value of UNK which is significant on the UNK test at the UNK level. #DISCUSSION# UNK UNK Individual differences in Kohnstamm reactivity to controlled Kohnstamm situations were found among the subjects used in the study. Only UNK UNK subjects) gave a positive Kohnstamm reaction when completely nai^ve concerning the phenomenon. There were UNK UNK subjects) who did not give a positive reaction even after they were informed of the UNK of such a reaction and had been given a demonstration. There were UNK UNK subjects) who shifted from a negative to a positive reaction after they were UNK as to the UNK of the Kohnstamm-positive reaction. Among this latter group there were also differences in the amount and kind of information necessary before a shift in reaction occurred. One subject changed when given only the information that some people have something happen to their arm when they UNK Five subjects UNK did not change until they had been told that some people have something happen to their arm, what that something was, and also were given a demonstration. Four subjects UNK did not change even then but needed the additional information that an arm-elevation under these circumstances was a perfectly normal UNK reaction which some people showed while others did not. At no time was it implied by the experimenter that the UNK initial reaction was UNK The subjects were only given information about UNK possibilities of "normal" UNK Those who responded with an arm-elevation in the nai^ve state did not change their reaction when told that there were some normal people who did not react in this fashion. This information was accepted with the frequent interpretation that those persons who did not show UNK must be preventing it. These subjects implied that they too could prevent their arms from rising if they tried. The positive Kohnstamm reactivity in UNK /1, (the nai^ve UNK is not adequately explained by such a concept as suggestibility (if suggestibility is defined as the influence on behavior by verbal UNK In no way, either verbally or UNK did the experimenter indicate to the subjects any preferred mode of responding to the voluntary UNK Moreover, when the experimenter did inform those subjects that there were some normal people who did not have their arm rise once they UNK the Kohnstamm-positive subjects were UNK in their subsequent reactions to the Kohnstamm situation. They continued to give an UNK A differential suggestibility would have to be invoked to explain the failure of this additional information to influence the Kohnstamm-positive reactors and yet attribute their nai^ve Kohnstamm reactivity to suggestion. UNK the reaction of the subject in such a way as to conform to his own expectations of the outcome (i&e&, that the UNK is a reaction to the pressure exerted in the voluntary UNK because of his knowledge that "to every reaction there is an equal and opposite UNK also seems inadequate as an explanation for the following reasons: (1) the UNK apparently genuine experience of surprise when their arms rose, and (2) manifestations of the phenomenon despite UNK of something else happening (e&g&, of becoming UNK and maybe falling, an expectation spontaneously volunteered by one of the UNK A suggestion hypothesis also seems inadequate as an explanation for those who shifted their reactions after they were informed of the possibilities of "normal" reactions different from those which they UNK While they were told that there were some normal people who reacted differently than they had, they were also informed that there were other UNK who reacted as they had. There was no implication made that their initial reaction UNK of an UNK was less preferred than the presence of UNK A more tenable explanation for the change in reactions is that the added knowledge and increased familiarity with the total situation made it possible for these subjects to be less guarded and to relax, since any reaction seemed acceptable to the examiner as UNK The nai^ve state, UNK /1,, could therefore be viewed as an UNK one for UNK of the subjects in this study. They were not free to be themselves in this situation, an UNK one, where there was an observer of their reactions and they had no guide for acceptable behavior. Instructions to relax, i&e&, to be UNK and react immediately to whatever impulse they might have, was not sufficiently reassuring until some idea of the possibilities of normal reactions had been given. While other conditions might be even more effective in bringing about a change from immobility to mobility in Kohnstamm UNK it is our hypothesis that all such conditions would have as a common factor the capacity to induce an attitude in the subject which enabled him to divorce himself temporarily from feelings of responsibility for his behavior. UNK UNK succeeded in changing immobility to mobility quite strikingly in one pilot subject (the only one with whom this technique was UNK This subject, who has been undergoing psychoanalytic psychotherapy for five years, did not give a positive Kohnstamm reaction under any of the four standardized conditions used in this experiment while UNK After two drinks containing UNK her arm flew upward very UNK There was evident delight on the part of the subject in response to her experience of the freedom of movement. She described herself as having the same kind of UNK feeling as she had once experienced under UNK She ascribed her delight with both experiences to the effect they seemed to have of temporarily removing from her the controls which she felt so compulsively necessary to maintain even when it might seem appropriate to relax these controls. Many subjects attributed differences in Kohnstamm reactivity to differences in degrees of subjective UNK voluntary as the Kohnstamm-positive subjects perceived it and UNK as the Kohnstamm-negative subjects perceived it. These suggested interpretations were given by the subjects spontaneously when they were told that there were people who reacted differently than they had. The Kohnstamm-positive subjects described the vivid experience of having their arms rise as one in which they exercised no control. They explained its absence in others on the basis of an intervention of control factors. They felt that they too could counteract the upward arm movement by a voluntary effort after they had once experienced the reaction. Some of those who did not initially react with an arm-elevation also associated their behavior in the situation with control UNK an inability to relinquish control UNK One subject spontaneously asked UNK her arm had finally UNK "Do you suppose I was unconsciously keeping it down UNK Another said that her arm did not go up at first "because I wouldn't let it; I thought it wasn't supposed UNK This subject was one who gave an arm-elevation on the second trial in the nai^ve state but not in the first. She had felt that her arm wanted to go up in the first trial, but had consciously prevented it from so doing. She explained UNK of others by saying that they were "not letting themselves UNK When informed that there were some persons who did not have their arm go up, she commented, "I don't see how they can prevent it". In contrast to this UNK explanation for UNK given by the Kohnstamm-positive subjects, the Kohnstamm-negative subjects offered an UNK hypothesis to explain UNK They felt that they were relaxing as much as they could and that any control factors which might be present to prevent response must be on an unconscious level. The above discussion does not mean to imply that control factors were completely in UNK in the Kohnstamm-positive UNK but rather that they could be diminished sufficiently not to interfere with UNK One Kohnstamm-positive subject who had both arms rise while being tested in the nai^ve condition described her subjective experience as follows: "You feel they're going up and you're on a stage and it's not right for them to do so and then you think maybe that's what's supposed to UNK She then described her experience as one in which she first had difficulty accepting for herself a state of being in which she relinquished control. However, she was able to relax and yield to the moment. It is our hypothesis that Kohnstamm-positive subjects are less hesitant about UNK control than are Kohnstamm-negative UNK that they can give up their control and allow themselves to be reactors rather than UNK It is our belief that this readiness to relinquish some control was evidenced by the Kohnstamm-positive subjects in some of the other experimental situations to be discussed below. Thus, this readiness to relax controls, evidenced in the Kohnstamm situation, appears to be a more general personality factor. UNK UNK The Kohnstamm-positive subjects seemed to be freer to experience the unusual and seemingly impossible in the external world. There was a significantly greater number in this group who reported a desk as being in a tilted position while a tennis ball resting on it remained UNK on the UNK This occurred in spite of the rational awareness that the ball should be going UNK They knew that their perceptual experience differed from objective reality since they had seen the desk and ball prior to putting on the UNK UNK Yet they were not so bound by past experience and UNK as to deny their immediate perceptions and to be dominated by their knowledge of what the experience should be. The change in perceptions by some of the Kohnstamm-negative subjects, after they had been informed of the possibilities of normal reactions, suggests that their UNK and UNK is associated with their general mode of responding to strange or unknown situations. They were able to experience at first, in terms of past UNK When informed as to the various possibilities of normal reactions, they were then able to experience the UNK of the present. It might be postulated that these subjects are unduly afraid of being wrong; that they perceive new internal and environmental situations as UNK until they are tested and proved otherwise. While the interpretations that have been given are UNK only, they gain support from such comments as the UNK which was made by one of the Kohnstamm-negative subjects who did not, on the first trial, perceive the tilt illusion. UNK OF UNK UNK It would have been desirable for the two communities to have differed only in respect to the variable being UNK the degree of structure in teaching method. The structured schools were in an industrial city, with UNK UNK houses typical of the residential areas, but with one rather sizable section of middle-class homes. The unstructured schools were in a large suburban community, predominantly middle- to UNK class, but fringed by an industrial area. In order to equate the samples on UNK status, we chose schools in both cities on the basis of UNK status of the neighborhoods. School principals and guidance workers made ratings of the various neighborhoods and the research team made independent observations of houses and dwelling areas. An objective scale was developed for rating school neighborhoods from these data. UNK proportions of children in each city were drawn from UNK and lower-middle class neighborhoods. UNK Individual differences in UNK and the development of readiness for learning to read indicate that not until the third grade have most children had ample opportunity to demonstrate their capacity for school achievement. Therefore, third-grade children were chosen as subjects for this study. For purposes of sample selection only UNK tests were given UNK we obtained group test scores of reading achievement and intelligence from school records of the entire third-grade population in each school system. The subjects for this study were UNK selected from UNK areas of the distribution, one-third as UNK one-third medium, and one-third UNK Children whose reading scores were at least one standard deviation below the regression line of each total third-grade school population were considered UNK for the purposes of sample selection. UNK were at least one standard deviation above the regression line in their school system. The final sample was not significantly different from a normal distribution in regard to reading achievement or intelligence test UNK UNK classrooms in twelve unstructured schools furnished UNK cases, UNK boys and UNK girls. Eight classrooms in three structured schools furnished 72 cases, 36 boys and 36 girls. Administrative restrictions necessitated the smaller sample size in the structured schools. It was assumed that the sampling procedure was purely random with respect to the personality variables under investigation. UNK UNK OF UNK An interview schedule of UNK questions and a UNK questionnaire were prepared, and one parent of each of the sample children was seen in the home. The parent was asked to describe the child's typical behavior in certain standard situations in which there was an opportunity to observe tendencies toward UNK in demands upon self and others, irrational conformity to rules, UNK UNK and need for certainty. The UNK were instructed not to suggest answers and, as much as possible, to record the parents' actual words as they described the child's behavior in home situations. The rating scale of compulsivity was constructed by first UNK the interview records, UNK all evidence related to UNK then arranging a distribution of such information apart from the case records. Final ratings were made on the basis of a point system which was developed after studying the distributions of actual UNK recorded and assigning weight values to each type of behavior that was UNK from the discovered norms. Children scoring high in compulsivity were those who gave evidence of tension or UNK in situations where there was lack of organization or conformity to standards and expectations, or who made exaggerated efforts to achieve these goals. The low compulsive child was one who appeared relatively unconcerned about such matters. For instance, the following statement was rated low in UNK UNK naturally quite neat about things, but it doesn't bother her at all if her room gets UNK But she UNK it up very well when I remind her". UNK OF UNK UNK <et al>& revised the Taylor UNK Scale for use with children. The Taylor Scale was adapted from the Minnesota UNK UNK UNK with item selection based upon clinical definitions of anxiety. There is much research evidence to UNK the use of the instrument in UNK individuals who are likely to manifest anxiety in varying degrees. UNK and UNK work with the UNK UNK Scale by UNK <et al>& demonstrated results closely similar to the findings with the adult scale. Although the Taylor Scale was designed as a group testing device, in this study it was individually administered by UNK trained workers who established rapport and assisted the children in reading the items. UNK OF ANXIETY TO UNK The question may be raised whether or not we are dealing with a common factor in anxiety and UNK The two ratings yield a correlation of UNK which is not significantly different from UNK therefore, we have measured two different characteristics. In theory, compulsive behavior is a way of diminishing anxiety, and one might expect a negative association except for the possibility that for many children the UNK defenses are not sufficient to UNK the amount of anxiety they UNK The issue of interaction between anxiety and compulsivity will be taken up later. UNK UNK In the primary grades, reading UNK almost every aspect of school progress, and the children's early experiences of success or failure in learning to read often set a pattern of total achievement that is relatively enduring throughout the following years. In establishing criterion measurements, it was therefore thought best to broaden the scope beyond the reading act itself. The predicted interaction effect should, if UNK extend its influence over all academic achievement. The UNK Achievement UNK Form UNK was administered by classroom teachers, consisting of a battery of six UNK UNK UNK Word UNK UNK UNK Arithmetic UNK and Arithmetic UNK All of these UNK involve reading except Arithmetic UNK UNK are stated in UNK on a national UNK The battery UNK UNK was used in data analysis in this study. The UNK UNK Scale for Children was administered to each sample third-grade child by a clinical worker. The relationship of intelligence test scores to school achievement is a well-established fact (in this case, UNK therefore, in the investigation of the present hypothesis, it was necessary to control this factor. The criterion score used in the statistical analysis is an index of UNK or UNK It is the discrepancy between the actual attained achievement test score and the score that would be predicted by the UNK For example, on the basis of the regression UNK a child with an I&Q& of 120 in this sample would be expected to earn an achievement test score of UNK UNK UNK If a child with an I&Q& of 120 scored 5.5 in achievement, his discrepancy score would be UNK representing UNK of one year of UNK A child with an I&Q& of UNK would be expected to earn an achievement test score of UNK If such a child scored UNK his discrepancy score would be UNK representing UNK of one year of UNK In this manner, the factors measured by the intelligence test were UNK allowing discovered differences in achievement to be interpreted as resulting from other variables. #RESULTS# _TEST OF UNK OF UNK AND UNK METHODS_ Tables 1 and 2 present the results of the statistical analysis of the data when compulsivity is used as the descriptive variable. Figure 1 portrays the mean achievement scores of each UNK UNK First of all, as we had UNK the highly compulsive children in the structured setting score significantly better (**f) on achievement than do similar children in the unstructured schools. It can be seen too that when we contrast levels of compulsivity within the structured schools, the high compulsive children do better (**f). No significant difference was found in achievement between high and low compulsive children within the unstructured school. The hypothesis of there being an interaction between compulsivity and teaching method was UNK in this case, at the UNK level. While we had expected that compulsive children in the unstructured school setting would have difficulty when compared to those in the UNK we were surprised to find that the achievement of the high compulsives within the schools where the UNK method is used in beginning reading compares favorably with that of the low UNK Indeed their achievement scores were somewhat better on an absolute basis although the difference was not significant. We speculate that compulsives in the unstructured schools are under greater strain because of the lack of UNK in their school setting, but that their need to organize (for UNK is so intense that they struggle to induce the UNK rules and achieve in spite of the lack of direction from the environment. It is interesting to note that medium compulsives in the unstructured schools made the lowest achievement scores (although not significantly UNK UNK their compulsivity was not strong enough to cause them to build their own structure. Our UNK is, then, that regardless of the manner in which school lessons are UNK the compulsive child UNK those elements of each lesson that aid him in UNK his work. When helped by a high degree of structure in lesson presentation, then, and only then, does such a child attain unusual success. _TEST OF UNK OF ANXIETY AND UNK METHODS_ The statistical analyses of achievement in relation to anxiety and teaching methods and the interactions of the two are presented in Tables 3 and 4. Figure 2 is a graph of the mean achievement scores of each group. As UNK the highly anxious children in the unstructured schools score more poorly (**f) than those in the structured schools. The interaction effect, which is significant at the UNK level, can be seen best in the contrast of mean UNK While high anxiety children achieve significantly less well (**f) in the unstructured school than do low anxiety children, they appear to do at least as well as the average in the structured classroom. The most striking aspect of the interaction demonstrated is the marked UNK in performance suffered by the highly anxious children in unstructured schools. According to the theory proposed, this is a consequence of the severe condition of perceived threat that persists UNK for the anxious child in an ambiguous sort of school environment. The fact that such threat is potent in the beginning reading lessons is thought to be a vital factor in the continued pattern of failure or UNK these children UNK The child with high anxiety may first direct his UNK energy toward achievement, but because his distress severely reduces the abilities of discrimination and UNK of complex symbols, the child may fail in his initial attempts to master the problem. Failure confirms the UNK and the intensity of anxiety is increased as the required learning becomes more difficult, so that by the time the child reaches the third grade the UNK in performance is UNK The individual with high anxiety in the structured classroom may approach the learning task with the same increased energy and lowered powers of UNK But the symbols he is asked to learn are simple. As shown earlier, the highly anxious individual may be superior in his UNK of simple elements. Success reduces the prospect of threat and his powers of discrimination are improved. By the time the child first attacks the actual problem of reading, he is completely familiar and at ease with all of the elements of words. Apparently academic challenge in the structured setting creates an optimum of stress so that the child with high anxiety is able to achieve because he is aroused to an energetic state without becoming confused or UNK UNK <et al>& present evidence that the anxious child will suffer in the UNK situation, and that his performance will be impaired unless he receives supporting and accepting treatment from the teacher. Although the present study was not a direct UNK of their investigations, the results do not confirm their conclusion. UNK in the two school systems studied here, judged the teachers in the structured schools to be more impersonal and UNK while the atmosphere in the unstructured schools was judged to be more supporting and UNK Yet the highly anxious child suffered a tremendous disadvantage only in the unstructured school, and performed as well or better than average in the structured setting. _ANALYSIS_ UNK means the evaluation of UNK the comparative ratings of parts, the comprehension of the meaning of isolated elements. UNK in roleplaying is usually done for the purpose of understanding strong and weak points of an individual or as a process to eliminate weak parts and strengthen good parts. UNK UNK Up to this point stress has been placed on roleplaying in terms of individuals. Roleplaying can be done for quite a different purpose: to evaluate procedures, regardless of individuals. For example: a sales presentation can be analyzed and evaluated through UNK UNK Let us now put some flesh on the theoretical bones we have assembled by giving illustrations of roleplaying used for evaluation and analysis. One should keep in mind that many of the exciting UNK of roleplaying are largely unexplored and have not been used in industry to the extent that they have been in military and other areas. UNK The president of a small firm selling restaurant products, had considerable difficulty in finding suitable salesmen for his business. UNK UNK UNK training the UNK having them go with more experienced salesmen was UNK and the rate of attrition due to UNK or unsatisfactory performance was too high. It was his experience that only one good salesman was found out of every seven UNK and only one was hired out of every seven UNK Roleplaying was offered as a UNK and the procedure worked as follows: all candidates were invited to a hotel conference room, where the president explained the difficulty he had, and how unnecessary it seemed to him to hire people who just did not work out. In place of asking salesmen to fill UNK UNK their UNK interviewing them, asking them to be tried out, he told them he would prefer to test them. Each person was to enter the testing room, carrying a UNK of samples. Each salesman was to read a sheet containing a description of the product. In the testing room he was to UNK UNK three presentations to three different people. In the testing room, three of the veteran salesmen served as UNK One handled the salesman in a friendly manner, another in a rough manner, and the third in a UNK manner. Each was told to purchase material if he felt like it. The antagonists came in, one at a time, and did not see or hear the other UNK After each presentation, the antagonist wrote his judgment of the UNK and so did the observers consisting of the president, three of his salesmen and a UNK Ten salesmen were tested in the morning and ten more in the afternoon. This procedure was repeated one day a month for four months. The batting average of one success out of seven increased to one out of three. The president of the firm, calculating expenses alone, felt his costs had dropped one-half while success in selection had improved over one hundred per cent. The reason for the value of this procedure was simply that the applicants were tested "at work" in different situations by the judgment of a number of experts who could see how the salesmen conducted themselves with UNK but typical restaurant owners and UNK They were, in a sense, UNK out" in realistic situations. From the point of view of the UNK less time was wasted in being UNK and they got a meal out of it as well as some insights into their performances. Another use of roleplaying for evaluation illustrates how this procedure can be used in real life situations without special equipment or special assistants during the daily course of work. The position of UNK was opened in a large office and an announcement was made to the other girls already working that they could apply for this job which had higher prestige and slightly higher salary than UNK and UNK positions. All applicants were generally familiar with the work of the UNK At the end of work one day, the personnel man took the applicants one at a time, asked them to sit behind the UNK desk and he then played the role of a number of people who might come to the UNK with a number of UNK and for a number of purposes. Each girl was independently UNK by the personnel man, and he served not only as the director, but as the antagonist and the UNK Somewhat to his surprise he found that one girl, whom he would never have considered for the job since she had appeared somewhat UNK and also had been in the office a relatively short time, did the most outstanding job of playing the role of UNK showing wit, UNK and UNK She was hired and was found to be entirely satisfactory when she played the role eight hours a day. _ANALYSIS_ In considering roleplaying for analysis we enter a more complex area, since we are now no longer dealing with a simple over-all decision but rather with the examination and evaluation of many elements seen in dynamic functioning. Some cases in evidence of the use of roleplaying for analysis may help explain the procedure. An engineer had been made the works manager of a firm, UNK a retired employee who had been considered UNK successful. The engineer had more than seven years of experience in the firm, was well trained, was considered a hard UNK was respected by his fellow engineers for his technical competence and was regarded as a UNK However, he turned out to be a complete failure in his new position. He seemed to UNK everyone. UNK rates of personnel went up, production UNK and morale was visibly reduced. Despite the fact that he was regarded as an outstanding engineer, he seemed to be a very poor administrator, although no one quite knew what was wrong with him. At the insistence of his own UNK the president of the firm, he enrolled in a course designed to develop leaders. He played a number of typical situations before UNK other supervisors who kept notes and then explained to him in detail what he did they thought was wrong. UNK concerned with efficiency, he was merciless in UNK people who made mistakes, condemning them to too great an extent. He did not really listen to others, had little interest in their ideas, and wanted to have his own way- which was the only right way. The entire group of managers explained, in great detail, a number of human relations errors that he made. One by one, these errors were discussed and one by one he rejected accepting them as errors. He admitted his behavior, and defended it. He refused to change his approach, and instead he attacked high and UNK the officials for their not backing him, and subordinates for their UNK UNK and UNK After the UNK he left the course, convinced that it could do him no good. We may say that his problem was UNK but that he refused treatment. The engineer turned works manager had a particular view of life- and refused to change it. We may say that his attitude was UNK since he may have been a success had he learned some human relations UNK or we may say that his attitude was UNK showing his independence of mind, in his refusal to adjust to the opinions of others. In any case, he refused to accept the implications of the analysis, that he needed to be made over. Another case may be given in illustration of a successful use of analysis, and also of the employment of a procedure for intensive analysis. In a course for UNK operators, a district manager who had been recently appointed to his position after being UNK successful as a store manager, found that in UNK other managers he was having a difficult time. On playing some typical situations before a jury of his UNK he showed some characteristics rated as UNK He was told he UNK for example, a sense of UNK and he answered: "Well, I am supposed to know all the answers, aren't I"? He was criticized for his UNK and UNK and he answered: "I am not working to become UNK On being criticized for his arbitrary behavior- he answered: "I have to make decisions. That's my job". In short, as frequently happens in UNK the individual feels threatened and UNK himself. However, in this case the district manager was led to see the errors of his ways. The necessary step between diagnosis and training is acceptance of the validity of the criticisms. How this was accomplished may be described, since this sometimes is a crucial problem. The director helped UNK a check list of the district UNK errors by asking various observers to write out sentences UNK on the mistakes they felt he made. These errors were then collected and written on a UNK UNK similar ideas. UNK errors were located, and then the director asked each individual to vote whether or not they felt that this manager had made the particular errors. They were asked to vote UNK if they thought they had seen him make the error, UNK if they thought he had not; and UNK UNK if they were not UNK The manager sat behind the group so he could see and count the hands that went up, and the director wrote the numbers on the UNK No comments were made during the voting. The results looked as follows: **f. The first eight of these eighteen statements, which received at least one-half of the UNK were UNK to form an analysis UNK for the particular manager, and when this particular manager UNK in other situations, the members checked any items that appeared. To prevent the manager from deliberately controlling himself only during the UNK they were rather lengthy (about twenty UNK the situations were UNK described to the manager so that he would not know what to expect, new antagonists were brought on the scene UNK and the antagonists were instructed to deliberately behave in such ways as to upset the manager and get him to operate in a manner for which he had been previously UNK After every session, the check marks were totaled up and UNK and in this way the UNK progress was UNK UNK In life we learn to play our roles and we UNK into patterns which become so UNK that we are not really aware of what we do. We can see others more clearly than we can see ourselves, and others can see us better than we see ourselves. To learn what we do is the first step for UNK To accept the validity of the judgments of others is the second step. To want to change is the third step. To practice new procedures under guided supervision and with constant feedback is the fourth step. To use these new ways in daily life is the last step. Roleplaying used for analysis follows these general steps leading to training. When an UNK situation is set up, and no concern is with the details that lead to an over-all UNK we say that roleplaying is used for evaluation. UNK can see a person engaged in spontaneous behavior, and watch him operating in a UNK fashion. This behavior is more UNK or true than other testing behavior for some types of UNK and so can give quick and accurate estimates of complex functioning. While roleplaying for testing is not too well understood at the present time, it represents one of the major uses of this procedure. #CHAPTER UNK UNK UNK THE UNK OF THIS UNK is to clarify the distinctions between spontaneity theory and other training concepts. In addition, the basic approach utilized in applying roleplaying will be UNK The goal will be to provide the reader with an integrated rationale to aid him in applying roleplaying techniques in this unique training area. The reasons for extracting this particular roleplaying application from the previous discussion of training are UNK _1._ UNK training theory is unique and relatively new. It is not easy for the therapist to discern when, in the patient's UNK an introject has appeared and is holding UNK One learns to become alert to changes in his vocal UNK to his UNK suddenly shifting to a quality not like his usual one, a quality which sounds somehow artificial or, in some instances, UNK The content of his words may lapse back into monotonous UNK as if a UNK needle were stuck in one UNK only seldom is it so simple as to be a matter of his obviously UNK some UNK UNK common to our culture, which he has evidently heard, over and over, from a parent until he experiences it as part of him. One hebephrenic woman often became submerged in what felt to me like a somehow phony experience of UNK during which, despite her UNK UNK and streaming UNK I felt only a cold UNK with her. Eventually such incidents became more UNK and more sharply UNK from her UNK behavior, and in one particular session, after several minutes of such behavior- which, as usual, went on without any accompanying words from her- she asked, UNK "Did you see UNK At first I did not know what she UNK I thought she must be seeing me as some one who had just come from seeing her UNK in their distant UNK Then I realized that she had been deliberately showing me, this time, what UNK was UNK and when I replied in this spirit, she UNK my UNK At another phase in the therapy, when a UNK UNK began to emerge more and more upon the investigative scene, she UNK in a low but intense voice, to herself, "I hate that woman inside me"! I could evoke no further UNK from her about this; but a few seconds later she was standing directly across the room from me, looking me in the eyes and saying in a UNK UNK tone, "Your father UNK you"! Again, I at first UNK this UNK intense communication, and I quickly cast through my mind to account for her being able to speak, with such utter conviction, of an opinion held by my father, now several years UNK Then I replied, UNK "If you despise me, why don't you say so, UNK She looked confused at this, and I felt sure it had been a wrong response for me to make. It then occurred to me to ask, "Is that what that woman told you"? She clearly agreed that this had been the case. I realized, now, that she had been showing me, in what impressed me as being a very accurate way, something her mother had once said to her; it was as if she was showing me one of the reasons why she hated that woman inside her. What had been an UNK powerful introject was now, despite its continuing charge of energy UNK to me, sufficiently within control of her ego that she could use it to show me what this UNK mother was like. UNK this woman had been so filled with a chaotic variety of UNK that at times, when she was in her room alone, it would sound to a UNK as though there were several different persons in the room, as she would UNK in various kinds of voice. A somewhat less fragmented hebephrenic patient of mine, who used to often UNK herself in her room, often sounded through the closed UNK as I would find on passing by, between our UNK for all the world like two persons, a UNK mother and a defensive child. Particularly hard for the therapist to grasp are those instances in which the patient is UNK an introject traceable to something in the UNK some aspect of the therapist of which the latter is himself only poorly aware, and the recognition of which, as a part of himself, he finds distinctly UNK I have found, time and again, that some bit of particularly annoying and UNK behavior on the part of a patient rests, in the final analysis, on this UNK and only when I can acknowledge this, to myself, as being indeed an aspect of my personality, does it cease to be a prominently troublesome aspect of the patient's behavior. For example, one hebephrenic man used to UNK me, month after month, by saying, whenever I got up to leave and made my fairly UNK comment that I would be seeing him on the following day, or UNK "You're UNK in a notably UNK UNK as though it were his due for me to thank him for the privilege of spending the hour with him, and he were thus pointing up my failure to utter a humbly UNK UNK UNK to him at the end of each session. Eventually it became clear to me, partly with the aid of another schizophrenic patient who could point out my UNK to me somewhat more directly, that this man, with his UNK "You're UNK was very accurately UNK an element of UNK UNK which had been present in my own UNK over these months, on each of these occasions when I had bid him UNK with the UNK note, each time, that the healing Christ would be stooping to dispense this UNK to the poor suffered again on the UNK Another patient, a UNK woman, for many months UNK not only me but the UNK and her fellow patients by UNK behaving as though she owned the whole building, as though she were the only person in it whose needs were to be met. This behavior on her part UNK only after I had come to see the UNK close similarity UNK on the one hand, her arranging the UNK of the common living room to her own liking, or turning the television off or on without regard to the wishes of the others, and on the other hand, my own coming UNK into her room despite her persistent and vociferous objections, bringing my big easy chair with me, usually UNK the windows of her room which she preferred to keep in a very cold state, and UNK myself down in my UNK in short, behaving as if I owned her room. #4. UNK Here a variety of meanings and emotions are UNK or reduced, in their communicative expression, to some comparatively UNK verbal or nonverbal statement. One finds, for example, that a UNK and stereotyped verbal expression, seeming at first to be a mere hollow convention, reveals itself over the months of therapy as the vehicle for expressing the most varied and intense feelings, and the most UNK of UNK More than anything, it is the UNK intuitive sensing of these latent meanings in the stereotype which helps these meanings to become UNK something like a UNK deck of cards, on sporadic occasions over the passage of the patient's and his months of work together. one cannot UNK of course, that all these accumulated meanings were inherent in the stereotype at the beginning of the therapy, or at any one time later on when the stereotype was UNK probably it is correct to think of it as a matter of a UNK stereotyped mode of UNK and no, or but a few, other UNK UNK as UNK being UNK available for the patient's use, as UNK emotions and ideas well up in him over the course of months. But it is true that the therapist can sense, when he hears this UNK that there are at this moment many emotional UNK at work in it, a blurred UNK of UNK voices which have yet to become clearly UNK from one another. Sometimes it is not a verbal UNK a "How are you now"? or an "I want to go UNK or UNK but a nonverbal one which reveals itself, gradually, as the condensed expression of more than one latent meaning. A hebephrenic man used to give a UNK wave of his hand a number of times during his UNK hours with his UNK When the therapist came to feel on sufficiently sure ground with him to ask him, "What is that, UNK UNK or UNK the patient replied, UNK UNK two in one". Of all the possible forms of nonverbal expression, that which seems best to give release, and UNK expression, to complex and UNK feelings is laughter. It is no coincidence that the hebephrenic patient, the most severely UNK of all schizophrenic patients, shows, as one of his characteristic UNK UNK laughter which now makes one feel UNK or hated, which now makes one feel like weeping, or which now gives one a glimpse of the bleak and empty expanse of man's UNK and which, more often than all these, conveys a UNK of feelings which could in no way be conveyed by any number of words, words which are so unlike this UNK in being formed and discrete from one another. To a much less full extent, the hebephrenic UNK UNK or UNK has a comparable communicative UNK in working with these patients the therapist eventually gets to do some at least private UNK over of the possible meaning of a UNK or the passage of UNK not only because he is reduced to this for lack of anything else to UNK but also because he learns that even these UNK sounds constitute forms of communication in which, from time to time, quite different things are being said, long before the patient can become sufficiently aware of these, as distinct feelings and UNK to say them in words. As I have been UNK in the UNK and perhaps also in the dreams of the UNK this is a question which I have no wish to take up- condensation is a phenomenon in which one finds not a condensed expression of various feelings and ideas which are, at an unconscious level, well UNK out, but rather a condensed expression of feelings and ideas which, even in the UNK have yet to become well differentiated from one another. Freeman, UNK and UNK in their description of the disturbances of thinking found in chronic schizophrenic patients, say, in regard to UNK that "**h the lack of adequate discrimination between the self and the environment, and the objects contained UNK **h in itself is the UNK UNK In my experience, a great many of the patient's more puzzling verbal communications are so for the reason that concrete meanings have not become differentiated from figurative meanings in his subjective experience. Thus he may be referring to some concrete thing, or incident, in his immediate environment by some UNK UNK reference to UNK events on the global scene. Recently, for example, a UNK woman's large-scale UNK in the session, about the UNK curiosity which has become, in her opinion, a UNK characteristic of UNK human culture, developed itself, before the end of the session, into a suspicion that I was UNK UNK at her partially exposed UNK as indeed I was. Or, equally often, a UNK UNK statement may UNK with its mundane UNK in a form of UNK may be full of meaning and emotion when interpreted as a figurative UNK a UNK a smile, an UNK or some other symbolic mode of UNK Of such hidden meanings the patient himself is, more often than not, entirely UNK His subjective experience may be a remarkably UNK one. One hebephrenic women confided to me, "I live in a world of UNK as if, to her, words were fully concrete objects; UNK in his excellent article (1955) concerning schizophrenic communication, includes mention of similar clinical material. A UNK schizophrenic young man told me that to him the various theoretical concepts about which he had been UNK in a most articulate fashion, during session after session with me, were like great UNK of almost UNK solid matter up in the air above him; as he spoke I was reminded of the great UNK of cargo which are UNK high in the air, from a UNK UNK The many linguistic techniques for reducing the amount of dictionary information that have been proposed all organize the UNK contents around UNK stems, UNK etc&. A significant reduction in the UNK of store information is thus realized, especially for a highly UNK language such as UNK For English the reduction in size is less UNK This approach requires that: (1) each text word be separated into smaller elements to establish a correspondence between the occurrence and dictionary UNK and (2) the information retrieved from several entries in the dictionary be UNK into a description of the particular word. The logical scheme used to accomplish the former influences the placement of information in the dictionary file. Implementation of the latter requires storage of information needed only for UNK We suggest the application of certain UNK techniques as a solution to the problem. But first, we must define two terms so that their meaning will be clearly UNK _1._ UNK any unique sequence of UNK characters that can appear in a language preceded and followed by a space. _2._ UNK an instance of a form in text. We propose a method for selecting only dictionary information required by the text being translated and a means for passing the information directly to the occurrences in text. We accomplish this by compiling a list of text forms as text is read by the computer. A UNK scheme, based on the spelling of forms, provides an economical way to UNK this text-form list. UNK forms found to match forms in the text list are UNK A location in the computer store is also named for each marked form; dictionary information about the form stored at this location can be retrieved directly by occurrences of the form in text. Finally, information is retrieved from the dictionary as required by stages of the translation UNK the grammatic description for UNK UNK UNK information for semantic analysis, and UNK equivalents for output construction. The dictionary is a form UNK at least in the sense that complete forms are used as the basis for matching text occurrences with dictionary UNK Also, the dictionary is divided into at least two UNK the list of dictionary forms and the file of information that pertains to these forms. A more detailed description of dictionary UNK text lookup and dictionary UNK give a clearer picture. Text UNK as we will describe it, consists of three steps. The first is compiling a list of text forms, assigning an information cell to each, and replacing text occurrences with the information cell assigned to the form of each occurrence. For this step the computer memory is separated into three UNK cells in the ~W-region are used for storage of the forms in the text-form UNK cells in the UNK and UNK region are reserved as information cells for text forms. When an occurrence **f is isolated during text reading, a random memory address **f, the address of a cell in the UNK is computed from the form of **f. Let **f denote the form of **f. If cell **f has not previously been assigned as the information cell of a form in the text-form list, it is now assigned as the information cell of **f. The form itself is stored in the next available cells of the UNK beginning in cell **f. The address **f and the number of cells required to store the form are written in **f; the information cell **f is saved to represent the text occurrence. Text reading continues with the next occurrence. Let us assume that **f is identical to the form of an occurrence **f which preceded **f in the text. When this situation exists, the address **f will equal **f which was produced from **f. If **f was assigned as the information cell for **f, the routine can detect that **f is identical to **f by comparing **f with the form stored at location **f. The address **f is stored in the cell **f. When, as in this case, the two forms UNK the address **f is saved to represent the occurrence **f. Text reading continues with the next occurrence. A third situation is possible. The formula for computing random addresses from the form of each occurrence will not give a distinct address for each distinct form. Thus, when more than one distinct form leads to a particular cell in the UNK a chain of information cells must be created to accommodate the forms, one cell in the chain for each form. If **f leads to an address **f that is equal to the address computed from **f, even though **f does not match **f, the chain of information cells is extended from **f by storing the address of the next available cell in the UNK **f, in **f. The cell **f becomes the second information cell in the chain and is assigned as the information cell of **f. A third cell can be added by storing the address of another ~Y-cell in **f; UNK as many cells are added as are required. Each information cell in the chain contains the address of the ~Y-cell where the form to which it is assigned is UNK Each cell except the last in the chain also contains the address of the ~Y-cell that is the next element of the UNK the absence of such a link in the last cell indicates the end of the chain. Hence, when the address **f is computed from **f, the cell **f and all UNK in its chain must be UNK to determine whether **f is already in the form list or whether it should be added to the form list and the chain. When the information cell for **f has been UNK it is saved as a representation of **f. Text reading continues with the next occurrence. Text reading is terminated when a UNK number of forms have been stored in the text-form list. This UNK the second step of glossary UNK connecting the information cell of forms in the text-form list to dictionary forms. Each form represented by the dictionary is looked up in the text-form list. Each time a dictionary form matches a text form, the information cell of the matching text form is saved. The number of dictionary forms skipped since the last one matched is also saved. These two pieces of information for each dictionary form that is matched by a text form constitute the table of dictionary UNK If each text form is marked when matched with a dictionary form, the text forms not contained in the dictionary can be identified when all dictionary forms have been read. The appropriate action for handling these forms can be taken at that time. Each dictionary form is looked up in the text-form list by the same method used to look up a new text occurrence in the form list during text reading. A random address **f that lies within the UNK of memory mentioned earlier is computed from the UNK dictionary form. If cell **f is an information cell, it and any information cells in the UNK that have been linked to **f each contain an address in the ~W-region where a potentially matching form is UNK The dictionary form is compared with each of these text forms. When a match is found, an entry is made in the table of dictionary UNK If cell **f is not an information cell we conclude that the UNK dictionary form is not in the text list. These two steps essentially complete the lookup operation. The final step merely uses the table of dictionary usage to select the dictionary information that pertains to each form matched in the text-form list, and uses the list of information cells recorded in text order to attach the appropriate information to each occurrence in text. The list of text forms in the ~W-region of memory and the contents of the information cells in the ~X and UNK are no longer required. Only the assignment of the information cells is important. The first stage of translation after glossary lookup is structural analysis of the input text. The UNK description of each occurrence in the text must be retrieved from the dictionary to permit such an analysis. A description of this process will serve to illustrate how any type of information can be retrieved from the dictionary and attached to each text occurrence. The grammatic descriptions of all forms in the dictionary are recorded in a separate part of the dictionary file. The order is identical to the ordering of the forms they UNK When entries are being retrieved from this file, the table of dictionary usage indicates which entries to skip and which entries to store in the computer. This UNK process takes place as the file is read. Each entry that is selected for storage is written into the next available cells of the UNK The address of the first cell and the number of cells used is written in the information cell for the form. (The address of the information cell is also supplied by the table of dictionary UNK When the complete file has been read, the grammatic descriptions for all text forms found in the dictionary have been stored in the UNK the information cell assigned to each text form contains the address of the grammatic description of the form it UNK Hence, the description of each text occurrence can be retrieved by reading the list of UNK UNK addresses and UNK the description indicated by the information cell for each occurrence. The only requirements on dictionary information made by the UNK operation are that each form represented by the dictionary be available for lookup in the text-form list and that information for each form be available in a sequence identical with the sequence of the forms. This leaves the ordering of entries variable. UNK an entry is a form plus the information that pertains to UNK Two very useful ways for modifying a UNK are the addition to the dictionary of complete UNK rather than single forms and the application of a single change to more than one dictionary form. The former is intended to decrease the amount of work necessary to extend dictionary coverage. The latter is useful for modifying information about some or all forms of a word, hence reducing the work required to improve dictionary UNK UNK the techniques developed at Harvard for generating a paradigm from a representative form and its UNK we can add all forms of a word to the dictionary at once. An extension of the principle would permit entering a grammatic description of each form. UNK could be assigned to the paradigm either at the time it is added to the dictionary or after the word has been studied in context. Thus, one can think of a dictionary entry as a word rather than a form. If all forms of a paradigm are grouped together within the UNK a considerable reduction in the amount of information required is possible. For example, the UNK forms of a word can be represented, insofar as regular UNK UNK by a stem and a set of UNK to be UNK UNK the set of UNK can be replaced by the UNK of a set of UNK The full forms can be derived from such information just prior to the lookup of the form in the text-form list. Similarly, if the equivalents for the forms of a word do not UNK the equivalents need be entered only once with an indication that they apply to each form. The dictionary system is in no way dependent upon such UNK or designed around it. When irregularity and variation prevent UNK information is written in complete detail. UNK are summarized only when by doing so the amount of information retained in the dictionary is reduced and the time required for dictionary operations is decreased. In sentences, patterns of stress are determined by complex combinations of influences that can only be suggested here. The tendency is toward putting dominant stress at the end. There is a parallel to this tendency in the assignment of time in UNK hymn UNK Thus the first lines of one of Charles UNK hymns are as follows. "A charge to keep I have, A God to UNK In the tune to which this hymn is most often sung, UNK the syllables UNK and UNK ending their lines, have twice the time any other syllables have. Dominant stress is of course more than extended UNK and normally centers on syllables that would have primary stress or phrase stress if the words or longer units they are parts of were spoken UNK a dominant stress given to UNK would normally center on its first UNK rather than its last. But the parallel is significant. When the answer to UNK wrong UNK is UNK broken a UNK dominant stress will usually be on the complement <a UNK From the point of view of UNK analysis the head word in the statement is the UNK UNK UNK and from the point of view of meaning it would seem that the trouble centers in the UNK but dominant stress will be assigned to UNK only in rather exceptional versions of the UNK In <I know one UNK dominant stress will usually be on the complement UNK UNK in UNK thing I UNK it will usually be on the UNK UNK In UNK people are very UNK dominant stress will generally be on the complement UNK UNK in the double sentence <the smaller the town, the UNK the UNK it will generally be on the subjects <the UNK and <the UNK In UNK a UNK dominant stress will generally be on the subject <a UNK in UNK a UNK it will generally be on the complement <a UNK Dominant stress is on UNK UNK both in UNK her UNK where UNK UNK is the UNK and in UNK her UNK where it is the subject. UNK second UNK however, are likely not to have dominant stress when they terminate UNK If the answer to <what was that UNK is UNK put the cat UNK dominant stress will ordinarily be on the first UNK <the UNK not the second complement UNK Final UNK may or may not have dominant stress. If the answer to <what was that UNK is UNK reads the news UNK dominant stress may or may not be on the adjunct UNK When prepositional UNK are divided as in <what are you looking UNK they are likely to lose dominant stress. UNK is of extreme importance. What is new in the context is likely to be made more prominent than what is not. Thus in a context in which there has been discussion of snow but mention of local conditions is new, dominant stress will probably be on UNK in <it rarely snows UNK but in a context in which there has been discussion of local weather but no mention of snow, dominant stress will probably be on UNK The personal UNK and substitute <one> are normally unstressed because they refer to what is prominent in the immediate context. In UNK go with UNK dominant stress is probably on UNK but if George has just been mentioned prominently (and the trip to be made has been under UNK what is said is probably UNK go with UNK and dominant stress is probably on the UNK UNK When a gesture UNK UNK UNK the personal UNK has dominant stress because UNK has not been mentioned previously. If both George and a piece of information George does not have are prominent in the context, but the idea of telling George is new, then dominant stress will probably be on UNK in UNK not tell UNK But when what is new in a particular context is also fairly obvious, there is normally only light stress or no stress at all. Thus the unstressed UNK of <it rarely snows UNK gets its significance from its use with UNK nothing can snow snow but UNK In UNK aren't many young people in the UNK the UNK UNK takes dominant stress away from its head UNK the fact that the young creatures of interest are people seems rather obvious. If UNK replaced UNK it would normally have dominant stress. In <I have things to UNK the word UNK makes little real contribution to meaning and has weaker stress than UNK If UNK is substituted for UNK (with more exact contribution to UNK it will have dominant stress. In <I know one UNK dominant stress is likely to go to <one> rather than to UNK pale UNK In <I knew you when you were a child, and you were pretty UNK dominant stress on <then> implies that the young woman spoken to is still UNK Dominant stress on UNK would be almost UNK here. In the written language <then> can be UNK or UNK to guide the reader here, but much of the time the written language simply depends on the UNK UNK and a careless reader will have to back up and UNK Often dominant stress simply indicates a centering of attention or emotion. Thus in UNK incredible what that boy can UNK dominant stress is likely to be on UNK and UNK will have strong stress also. In UNK has it in for UNK dominant stress will ordinarily be on UNK where the notion of UNK antipathy seems to center. In UNK painting at our UNK strong stress on UNK indicates that the job being done is not real painting but simply an effort at painting. Where there is comparison or contrast dominant stresses normally operate to center attention. Thus in <his friends are stranger than his UNK strong stresses are normal for <his> and UNK but in <his friends are stranger than his UNK strong stresses are normal for UNK and UNK In UNK hurting himself more than he's hurting UNK both UNK and <you> have stronger stress than they would ordinarily have if there were no contrast. In <is she Chinese or UNK the desire to contrast the first parts of words which are alike in their last components produces an exceptional disregard of the normal patterns of stress of UNK and UNK Sometimes strong stress serves to focus an important secondary relationship. Thus in UNK wrote an account of the trip UNK strong stress on UNK marks Mary as the first in a series of people who wrote accounts of the trip, strong stress on UNK marks the writing as the first of a series of actions of Mary's concerned with an account of her trip (about which she may later have made speeches, for UNK and strong stress on UNK makes the trip the first of a series of subjects about which Mary wrote accounts. In UNK UNK man UNK the situation is very similar. Strong stress on UNK treats hunger as an additional UNK strong stress on UNK treats stimulation as an additional effect of hunger, strong stress on UNK treats man as an additional creature who responds to the stimulation of UNK Here again, in the written language it is possible to help the reader get his stresses right by using UNK or UNK but much of the time there is simply reliance on his understanding in the light of context. When a word represents a larger construction of which it is the only expressed part, it normally has more stress than it would have in fully expressed construction. Thus when UNK I UNK is the response to <have you finished reading the UNK the stress on UNK which here represents <have finished reading the UNK is quite strong. In UNK the leader at camp, but Jack is UNK the <is> of the second main declarative represents <is the UNK and therefore has stress. UNK the leader at camp, but Jack's UNK with this <is> deprived of stress, makes UNK the complement in the UNK In UNK all the suggestions that were made, his was the UNK the UNK <his> represents <his UNK and is stressed. When UNK represents itself and a complement UNK UNK say, to UNK to UNK in UNK boat did Jack go UNK it has strong UNK when it represents only itself and <on UNK is its complement (so that UNK UNK is UNK equivalent to UNK <on> has stronger stress than UNK does. UNK of a UNK UNK however, does not result in an increase in stress on a prepositional UNK for which the UNK UNK would be object. Thus <to> has light stress both in <that was the conclusion that I came UNK and in <that was the conclusion I came UNK But when <to> represents <to UNK in <that was the moment that I came UNK and similarly in <that was the moment I came UNK there is much stronger stress on UNK In <I wanted to tell him, but I was afraid UNK the final <to> is lightly stressed because it represents <to tell UNK In <to tell UNK of course, <to> is normally UNK When <I have instructions to UNK is equivalent in meaning to <I have instructions that I am to leave this UNK dominant stress is ordinarily on UNK When the same sequence is equivalent in meaning to <I have instructions which I am to UNK dominant stress is ordinarily on UNK It is clear that patterns of stress sometimes show construction UNK in the spoken language where without the help of context it would be ambiguous in the written. Other examples follow. "I'll come by Tuesday. I can't be happy long without drinking UNK In the first of these sentences if <by> is the complement of UNK and UNK is an adjunct of time equivalent to <on UNK there will be strong stress on <by> in the spoken language; but if a complement for UNK is implied and <by UNK is a prepositional unit used as an UNK <by> will be unstressed or lightly stressed at most. In the second sentence if UNK water> is a UNK clause and <without drinking water> is roughly equivalent in meaning to UNK I drink UNK there will be stronger stress on UNK than on UNK but if UNK is a UNK UNK modifying UNK and <without drinking water> is equivalent to <without water for UNK there will be stronger stress on UNK than on UNK But the use of stress in comparison and contrast, for example, can undermine distinctions such as these. And patterns of stress are not always unambiguous by any means. In <the UNK have busy lives without visiting relatives> only context can indicate whether UNK relatives> is equivalent in meaning to UNK visits to relatives> or to UNK who are visiting UNK and in <I looked up the UNK and <I looked up the UNK only the meanings of UNK and UNK make it clear that UNK is UNK a second complement in the first sentence and a UNK followed by its object in the second. UNK UNK are linguistic units centering in peaks which are usually UNK but, as has been noted, are consonantal under certain circumstances, and which may or may not be combined with preceding and/or following consonants or combinations of UNK UNK are genuine units, but division of words and sentences into them presents great difficulties. Sometimes even the number of syllables is not clear. UNK on this point is strongest before UNK and UNK or UNK From the point of view of word formation <real> might be expected to have two UNK UNK UNK is the UNK that is employed also in UNK and UNK is the common UNK When UNK is added, <real> clearly has two UNK But there is every reason to regard UNK as a UNK and because of the fact that UNK commonly has the quality of UNK when it follows vowel UNK UNK seems to be a perfectly satisfactory UNK with UNK It is obvious enough that linguists in general have been less successful in coping with tone systems than with consonants or UNK No single explanation is adequate to account for this. UNK however, is UNK and at least three things will be needed. The first is a UNK sample of successful tonal analyses. Even beginning students in linguistics are made familiar with an appreciable variety of consonant systems, both in their general outlines and in many specific details. An advanced student has read a considerable number of descriptions of consonantal systems, including some of the more unusual types. By contrast, even experienced linguists commonly know no more of the range of possibilities in tone systems than the UNK distinction between register and contour languages. This limited familiarity with the possible phenomena has severely hampered work with tone. Tone analysis will continue to be difficult and unsatisfactory until a more representative selection of systems is UNK to every practicing field UNK UNK like these four, if widely read, will contribute importantly to improvement of our analytic work. The second need is better field techniques. The great majority of present-day linguists fall into one or more of a number of UNK types: those who are convinced that tone cannot be UNK those who are personally scared of tone and tone languages generally, those who are convinced that tone is merely an unnecessary marginal feature in those languages where it occurs, those who have no idea how to proceed with tone analysis, those who take a UNK view of the whole matter. The result has been neglect, UNK efforts, or superficial treatment. As these UNK UNK so must the UNK UNK such as these four will simultaneously combat the assumptions that tone is impossible and that it is simple. They will give suggestions that can be worked up into field procedures. Good field techniques will not only UNK linguists for better work, but also help them overcome negative attitudes. Actually, none of these papers says much directly about field techniques. But it is worth UNK that very little has been published on any phase of field techniques in UNK These things have been disseminated by other means, but always in the wake of extensive publication of analytic results. The third need is for better theory. We should expect that general phonologic theory should be as adequate for tone as for consonants and UNK but it has not been. This can only be for one of two reasons: either the two are quite different and will require totally different theory (and hence UNK or our existing theories are insufficiently general. If, as I suspect, the problem is largely of the second sort, then development of a theory better able to handle tone will result automatically in better theory for all phonologic subsystems. One issue that must be faced is the relative difficulty of analysis of different phonologic subsystems. Since tone systems typically comprise fewer units than either consonant or vowel systems, we might expect that they would be the easiest part of a phonologic analysis. Actual practice does not often work out this way. Tone systems are certainly more complex than the number of units would suggest, and often UNK more difficult than much larger consonantal systems. UNK has suggested one explanation. Tone languages use for linguistic contrasts speech parameters which also function heavily in UNK use. This may both UNK the attention of the UNK and cause confusion for the more UNK The problem is to UNK the linguistic features of pitch from the UNK UNK features. Of course, something of the same sort occurs with other sectors of the UNK consonantal UNK have both a linguistic and an individual UNK But in general the individual variation is a small thing added onto basic linguistic features of greater magnitude. With tone, individual differences may be greater than the linguistic contrasts which are superimposed on them. UNK differences from one speaker to another, or from one emotional state to another, may far exceed the small differences between UNK However, any such suggestion accounts for only some of the difficulties in hearing tone, or in developing a realistic attitude about tone, but not for the analytic difficulties that occur even when tone is meticulously recorded. A second explanation is suggested by the material described in UNK paper. Tone and intonation often become seriously UNK Neither can be adequately UNK until we are able to separate the two and assign the observed phenomena individually to one or the other. Other pairs of phonologic subsystems also UNK or UNK in this UNK for example, duration sometimes figures in both the vowel system and the UNK Some UNK features, for example UNK catch or UNK are sometimes to be assigned to UNK UNK and sometimes to UNK systems. But no other two phonologic systems are as difficult to UNK as are tone and intonation in some languages. This explanation of tone difficulties, however, does not apply in all languages. In some (the UNK type mentioned above) interaction of tone and intonation is restricted to the ends of intonation UNK In many of the UNK intonation can be safely UNK and much of the tonal analysis can be done without any study of UNK Still, even in such languages tone analysis has not been as simple as one might expect. A third explanation is suggested by UNK analysis of UNK tone. There we see a basically simple phonemic system UNK in a very complex and puzzling morphophonemic system. While the UNK can be very easily stated, no one is likely to be satisfied with the statement until phonemic occurrences can be related in some way to UNK units, UNK until the morphophonemics is worked out, or at least far enough that it seems reasonable to expect success. In the UNK tone UNK tonal morphophonemics is of the same order of complexity as consonantal UNK The phonemic systems which must support these morphophonemic systems, however, are very different. The inventory of tones is much smaller, and commonly the contrasts range along one single UNK pitch level. UNK systems are not merely larger, they are UNK UNK rules may be thought of as joining certain points in the system. The possibilities in the consonantal system are very numerous, and only a small portion of them are actually used. UNK connected by a morphophonemic rule commonly show a good bit of UNK UNK possible because of the several dimensions of contrast in the system. UNK morphophonemics, in a common case, can do nothing but either raise or lower the tone. The possibilities are few, and the total number of rules may be considerably greater. Often, therefore, there are a number of rules having the same effect, and commonly other sets of rules as well, having the opposite effect. UNK morphophonemics is much more UNK to the beginning analyst than consonantal morphophonemics, even when the total number of rules is no greater. The difficulty of analysis of any UNK in the phonology is an inverse function of the UNK smaller systems are more UNK for any given degree of morphophonemic UNK This hypothesis will account for a large part of the difficulties of tonal analysis, as well as the fact that vowel systems are often more puzzling than consonantal systems. The statement of the system is a different matter. UNK systems can of course be stated much more UNK A phonemic system can be stated without reference to morphophonemics, but it cannot always be found without UNK And the more complex the morphophonemic system is in relation to the phonemic base, the less easily a phonemic system will be UNK without close attention to the UNK at least, the less satisfying will a phonemic statement be if it cannot be related through morphophonemic rules to UNK meaningful structures. The design of UNK has received much less attention from linguists than the problem UNK There has been a tendency on the part of many American linguists to assume that a phonemic UNK will automatically be the best possible orthography and that the only real problem will then be the social one of securing acceptance. This seems naive. Most others have been content to give only the most general attention to the UNK and most obvious features of the phonology when designing UNK Apparently the feeling is that anything more would be involvement in technical UNK of possible UNK interest but of no visible significance in practical affairs. The result of this attitude has been the domination of many orthography conferences by such considerations as UNK UNK which usually turns out to be nothing more than certain prejudices carried over from European languages. Many of the suggested systems seem to have only the most tenuous relationship to the language structures that they UNK to UNK UNK have not always been more enlightened than UNK people" and sometimes have insisted on incredibly trivial points while neglecting things of much greater significance. As a result, many people have been confirmed in their conviction that orthography design is not an activity to which experts can contribute anything but confusion. A& E& UNK in UNK and UNK in UNK UNK one set of related orthographic questions and its phonologic background in detail. His objective is merely to determine "what distinctions of length and UNK it may be desirable to make explicit in a UNK UNK UNK To do so, he finds it necessary to examine the relevant parts of the phonology thoroughly and in detail. In the process, he develops some very significant observations about problems of a sort that are often difficult. A few of his examples are of very great interest, and the whole discussion of some importance for theory. His orthographic recommendations are no UNK acceptance of UNK on the one hand or of UNK on the other. Rather he weighs each phonologic fact in the light of its orthographic UNK He concludes that some changes can made in the current orthography which will appreciably improve its UNK but UNK to suggest precise graphic devices to effect these changes. I hope his suggestions are given the consideration they deserve in UNK circles. This, however, will not exhaust their practical UNK as they rather clearly indicate what thorough phonologic investigation can contribute to orthography design. We need many more studies of this sort if the design of written languages is to be put on a sound basis. One other paper deals with a phonologic problem: UNK Harmony in UNK by J& UNK This UNK the already widely known facts in terms of UNK As a restatement it makes only a small contribution to knowledge of UNK But it would seem more intended as a tract advocating the prosodic theory than a paper directed to the specific problems of UNK UNK The paper has a certain value as a comparatively easy introduction to this approach, particularly since it treats a fairly simple and straightforward phenomenon where it is possible to compare it with a more traditional (though not UNK statement. It does show one feature of the system that has not been previously described. But it does not, as it claims, demonstrate that this could not be treated by traditional methods. It seems to me that it rather easily can. Five of the papers deal with UNK problems. On the whole they maintain much the same high standard, but they are much more difficult to discuss in detail because of their wider variety of subject matter. My comments must be UNK than the papers UNK W& H& UNK writes on The UNK UNK in UNK This must be considered primarily an amendment and supplement to his early A short UNK of UNK in UNK It exhibits much the same descriptive technique and is open to much the same criticisms. The treatment seems UNK UNK and complex, largely because the method is UNK and the analysis seems never to be pushed to a satisfactory or even a consistent UNK There are more stems per item in Athabascan, which expresses the fact that the Athabascan languages have undergone somewhat more change in UNK from UNK than the Yokuts languages from UNK This may be because the Athabascan UNK began UNK or again because the Athabascan languages spread over a very much larger territory (including three wholly separated UNK or both. The differentiation however is not very much greater, as shown by the fact that Athabascan shows UNK stems per meaning UNK as against UNK for Yokuts, with a slightly greater number of languages represented in our UNK 24 as against 21. UNK deduction of UNK from UNK the UNK rate becomes UNK against UNK in equivalent number of UNK These general facts are mentioned to make clear that the total situation in the two families is similar enough to warrant comparison. The greatest difference in the two sets of figures is due to differences in the two sets of lists used. These differences in turn result from the fact that my Yokuts UNK were built up of terms selected mainly to insure UNK of English meaning between illiterate UNK and myself, within a compact and uniform territorial area, but that Hoijer's vocabulary is based on UNK second glottochronological list which aims at eliminating all items which might be culturally or geographically determined. Swadesh in short was trying to develop a basic list that was UNK I, one that was specifically adapted to the San UNK UNK The result is that I included 70 animal names, but Swadesh only UNK and somewhat similarly for plants, 16 as against 4. UNK and therefore UNK felt compelled to UNK all terms denoting species or even UNK UNK UNK UNK yellow UNK UNK their classes of animal and plant terms are restricted to generalizations or recurrent parts UNK UNK tree, grass, UNK tail, bark, UNK The groups are therefore really UNK in content as well as in size. Other classes are included only by myself UNK UNK or only by Swadesh and UNK UNK UNK What we have left as reasonably comparable are four UNK (1) body parts and products, which with a UNK nearly even representation UNK terms out of UNK 25 out of UNK come out with nearly even UNK 2.6 and UNK (2) UNK UNK terms against UNK ratios UNK versus UNK (3) UNK UNK 15 terms), ratios UNK versus UNK (4) UNK UNK 22 terms), ratios UNK versus UNK It will be seen that where the scope is UNK the Athabascan ratios come out somewhat higher (as indeed they ought to with a total ratio of UNK as against 3.5 or UNK except for UNK where alone the Athabascan ratio is lower. This exception may be connected with Hoijer's use of a much higher percentage of UNK UNK of his total list as against UNK in mine. Or the exception may be due to a particular UNK peculiar to the Athabascan UNK More word class ratios determined in more languages will no doubt ultimately answer the question. UNK If word classes differ in their resistance or liability to stem replacement within meaning UNK it is conceivable that individual meanings also differ with fair UNK UNK Hoijer's Athabascan and my Yokuts share 71 identical meanings (with allowance for several UNK like UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK For Yokuts, I UNK these 71 items in five columns, according as they were expressed by 1, 2, 3, 4, and more than 4 stems. The totals for these five categories are not too UNK namely 20, 15, 11, 16, 9 respectively. For Athabascan, with a greater range of stems, the first two of five corresponding columns were UNK 1 and 2 UNK the three others had to be spread UNK and are headed respectively **f; **f; and **f stems. While the particular limits of these groupings may seem artificially UNK they do fairly express a corresponding grouping of more variable material, and they UNK also in five classes, along a similar scale, containing approximately equal numbers of cases, namely 19, 14, 15, 11, 12 in UNK When now we count the frequency of the 71 items in the two language families appearing in the same column or grade, or one column or grade apart, or two or three or four, we find these UNK **f This distribution can be summarized by averaging the distance in grades UNK **f; which, divided by **f gives a mean of UNK grades apart. If the distribution of the 71 items were wholly UNK in the two families, the distance would of course be 0. If it were wholly random and UNK it would be UNK assuming the five classes were equal in ~<n>, which approximately they are. The actual mean of UNK being about halfway between 0 of complete correlation and UNK of no UNK it is evident that there is a pretty fair degree of similarity in the behavior even of particular INDIVIDUAL items of meaning as regards long-term stem UNK UNK In 1960, David D& Thomas published Basic UNK in some UNK UNK UNK 2, UNK 3, pp& UNK which compares 8 UNK languages with the UNK language data on which Swadesh based the revised retention rate (**f) in place of original (**f), and his revised 100 word basic glottochronological list in UNK Greater UNK **h UNK UNK Thomas' findings are, first, "that the individual items vary greatly and UNK in their UNK but, second, "that the semantic groups are surprisingly UNK in their average UNK (as between UNK and UNK His first conclusion, on behavior of individual items, is UNK whereas mine (on UNK and UNK was partially positive. His second conclusion, on semantic word classes, agrees with mine. This second conclusion, independently arrived at by independent study of material from two pairs of language families as different and remote from one another as these four are, cannot be ignored. Thomas also presents a simple equation for deriving an index of UNK which weights not only the number of stems UNK per meaning, but their relative UNK Thus his persistence values for some stem frequencies per meaning is: stem identical in 8 languages, UNK stem frequencies 7 and 1, UNK stem frequencies 4 and 4, UNK stem frequencies 4, 3, and 1, UNK His formula will have to be UNK may be altered or UNK and it should be tested on additional bodies of material. But consideration of the frequency of stems per constant meaning seems to be established as having significance in comparative situations with UNK and UNK UNK and UNK presumably is on the way with a further contribution in this area. As to relative frequencies of competing roots UNK vs& UNK UNK Thomas with his UNK seems to be the first to have considered the significance this might have. The problem needs further exploration. I was at least conscious of the distinction in my full Yokuts presentation that awaits publication, in which, in listing UNK UNK I set off by UNK those forms in which ~<n> of stem ~B was **f of stem UNK the UNK ones standing for **f; or under UNK UNK I set off by UNK cases where the combined ~<n> of stems **f was **f. UNK These findings, and others which will in time be developed, will affect the method of glottochronological inquiry. If adjectival meanings show relatively low UNK of stems, as I am confident will prove to be the case in most languages of the world, why should our basic lists include 15 per cent of these unstable forms, but only 8 per cent of animals and plants which replace much more UNK Had UNK substituted for his 15 adjectival UNK 15 good animal and plant items, his rate of stem replacement would have been lower and the age of Athabascan language separation UNK And irrespective of the outcome in centuries elapsed since UNK calculations obviously carry more UNK and comparable meaning if they deal with the most stable units than with variously unstable ones. It is evident that Swadesh has not only had much experience with basic vocabulary in many languages but has acquired great UNK and feeling for the UNK behavior of UNK items. Why then this urge to include unstable items in his basic UNK It is the urge to obtain a list as free of geographical and cultural conditioning as possible. And why that UNK It is the hope of attaining a list of items of UNK occurrence. But it is becoming increasingly evident that such a hope is a UNK Not that such a list cannot be UNK but the nearer it comes to attaining UNK the less significant will it be UNK Its terms will tend to be UNK or vague, and they will fit actual languages more and more UNK The practical operational problem of lexicostatistics is the establishment of a basic list of items of meaning against which the particular forms or terms of languages can be matched as the medium of comparison. The most important quality of the meanings is that they should be as UNK as possible. In proportion as meanings are concrete, we can better rely on their being insulated and UNK An elephant or a fox or a UNK or a UNK or a UNK possess in unusually high degree this quality of obvious, UNK UNK UNK as do an eye or tooth or UNK They isolate out easily, naturally, and UNK from the UNK of nature and UNK and they should be given priority in the basic list as long as they continue to show these qualities. With the universal list as his weapon, Swadesh has extended his march of conquest farther and farther into the past, UNK UNK twelve UNK back. And he has proclaimed greater or less UNK between all Western UNK languages. Some of this may prove to be true, or even considerable of it, whether by genetic UNK or by diffusion and UNK But the farther out he moves, the UNK will be his hold on conclusive evidence, and the larger the speculative component in his UNK He has traversed provinces and UNK but he has not consolidated them behind him, nor does he control them. He has announced results on UNK UNK UNK and almost all other American families and UNK and has UNK their degree of UNK but he has not worked out by lexicostatistics one UNK complete classification of even a single family other than UNK That is his UNK The remote, UNK possible has values of its UNK values of UNK UNK potential, and imagination. But there is also a firm aspect to UNK the aspect of learning the internal organization of obvious natural genetic groups of languages as well as their more remote and UNK external UNK of classification first, with elapsed age merely a UNK of acquiring UNK knowledge of what happened in Athabascan, in Yokuts, in UNK in the last few thousand years as well as forecasting what more UNK may have happened between them. This involves UNK progress, and such will have to be the day-by-day work of lexicostatistics as a growing body of scientific inquiry. If of the UNK of UNK Swadesh has escaped our steady UNK and UNK has repudiated his own share in the UNK that is no reason why we should UNK UNK There is no apparent reason why we should feel bound by UNK rules and procedure since his UNK and aims have grown so UNK It seems time to consider a revision of operational procedures for UNK studies on a more humble, UNK and limited basis. I would propose, first, an abandonment of attempts at a universal UNK list, as intrinsically UNK and UNK inadequate in proportion as it is achieved. I would propose, next, as the prime requirement for constitution of new basic UNK items whose forms show as high an empirical retention rate as possible. There would be no conceivable sense in going to the opposite extreme of selecting items whose forms are the most UNK An attempted middle course might lead to devices like a UNK UNK dictionary from which every UNK word was selected. UNK it was inevitable that differences of opinion should arise about the methods for applying these policies. It was nevertheless almost incredible that four years after Yalta there should be a complete split over Germany, with hot heads on both sides planning to use the Germans against their former allies, and with UNK Germans expecting to recover their power by fighting on one side or the other. UNK UNK UNK When the Yalta Conference opened, the American policy of UNK all discussion of Russia's western boundaries until the peace conference had broken down. Starting in great force late in December, from a line stretching from East UNK to UNK the Red armies had swept two hundred miles across Poland to the UNK thirty miles from Berlin, and the Upper UNK region was being rapidly UNK while the Western Allies had not yet occupied all of the left bank of the UNK The long delay in opening the Second UNK was now working to Russia's advantage. The West was now glad to propose the UNK Curzon UNK which was substantially Russia's 1941 UNK as the boundary between Russia and Poland. When this proposal was made, Stalin spoke with stronger emotion than at any other time during the UNK He stood up to emphasize his strong feeling on the subject. The bitter memory of Russia's exclusion from the Paris Peace Conference and of the West's effort to stamp out UNK at its birth boiled up within him. "You would drive us into UNK he declared. The White Russians and the UNK would say that Stalin and Molotov were far less reliable defenders of Russia than Curzon and UNK Yet after long and earnest discussion Stalin accepted the Curzon Line and even agreed voluntarily that there should be UNK from that line of five to eight kilometers in favor of Poland in some regions. He did not mind the Line itself, which Churchill declared in the House of UNK on February 27, 1945, he had always believed to be "just and right", but he did not want it called by a hated name. The West had long since forgotten the events of UNK but it was not so easy for the Red leaders, who felt that they had suffered great injustice in that period. In the UNK memorandum of February 4, 1942, the State Department had expected to be able to hold Russia in check by withholding agreement to her 1941 UNK Now Stalin made it clear that he meant to move UNK western borders deep into Germany, back to the western UNK River lines, taking not only East UNK and all of UNK but UNK and the tip of UNK back to and including UNK From six to nine million additional Germans would be UNK though most would have fled, and Poland would receive far more from Germany than the poor territories, including the great UNK UNK which she lost to Russia. Stalin declared that he preferred to continue the war a little longer, UNK it costs us blood", in order to give Poland compensation in the West at the expense of the UNK By this time Churchill was not so cordial toward moving Poland westward as he had been at UNK where he and Eden had both heartily approved the idea. After "a prolonged study of the UNK line on a UNK at UNK Churchill UNK the UNK He would tell the UNK he said, that they had been UNK a fine place to live in, more than three hundred miles each way". At Yalta he thought more about the six million Germans who would have to leave, trying to find work in Germany, and Roosevelt objected to the Western UNK River being chosen in the south, instead of the Eastern UNK both of which flow into the UNK The issue was left in UNK presumably for the peace conference. However, there was no real question of the justice of creating a strong Poland, both UNK and UNK and one UNK by large minorities of Germans or Russians. The moving of millions of the German UNK from the very heart of UNK to make room for the Polish UNK whom they had UNK and openly planned to UNK was a drastic operation, but there was little doubt that it was historically UNK UNK Of more importance to the West than UNK boundaries was the character of her government. At Yalta the West still believed that Eastern Europe could be kept in its orbit, in spite of the UNK Soviet armies. Though little democracy had ever been UNK in this region, and much of it was still ruled by UNK means, it was taken for granted that at least the forms of Western democracy would be established in this area and Western capitalism preserved within it. UNK UNK as they did in Anglo-Saxon institutions, it was important to both Roosevelt and Churchill that the UNK should have them. The issue was acute because the UNK Polish Government in London, supported in the main by Britain, was still competing with the new Lublin Government formed behind the Red Army. More time was spent in trying to marry these UNK than over any subject discussed at Yalta. The result was an agreement that the Lublin Government should be UNK on a broader democratic basis with the inclusion of democratic leaders from Poland itself and from the UNK UNK and pledged to hold "free and unfettered elections as soon as possible on the basis of universal suffrage and secret UNK All UNK and UNK UNK were to have the right to campaign. Roosevelt acted as UNK of the long debate on this issue. It was a matter of principle with Churchill, since Britain had declared war in behalf of Poland. To Stalin it was a matter of life and death. He made this completely clear. Speaking with "great UNK he said: "For the Russian people, the question of Poland is not only a question of honor but also a question of security. Throughout history, Poland has been the corridor through which the enemy has passed into Russia. Twice in the last thirty years our enemies, the Germans, have passed through this corridor. It is in Russia's interest that Poland should be strong and powerful, in a position to shut the door of this corridor by her own force **h. It is necessary that Poland should be free, independent in power. Therefore, it is not only a question of honor but of life and death for the Soviet state". In other words, the Soviet Union was determined to create a Poland so strong as to be a powerful bulwark against Germany and so closely tied to Russia that there would never be any question of her serving as a UNK UNK against the Soviets or posing as an independent, balancing power in between Russia and Germany. UNK says that invariably thereafter the Soviets used the same security argument to justify their course in Poland. This reasoning was also as inevitable as anything could be. Any free elections that were to be held in Poland would have to produce a government in which Moscow had complete confidence, and all pressure from the West for free voting by UNK elements in Poland would be met by restrictions on voting by these elements. UNK UNK UNK In even greater degree the same rule applied to the remainder of Eastern Europe, where the upper classes had generally collaborated with the Nazis, even to the extent of sending millions of their peasants into Russia as a part of Hitler's armies. But at Yalta the conflicting expectations of East and West were merged into an agreement by the Big Three to assist all liberated countries in Europe "to create democratic institutions of their own UNK In any case UNK in their judgment conditions UNK UNK UNK they would UNK interim governmental authorities broadly representative of all democratic elements in the population and pledged to the earliest possible establishment through free elections of governments responsive to the will of the people". Other similar UNK in the Declaration on UNK Europe seemed to assure democratic institutions on the Western model. Later it developed that the Soviets had a very different interpretation of democracy, which will be discussed later, and their judgment never told them that the Big Three should unite in establishing democratic conditions, as we understand them, within their zone of influence. Professor UNK thinks that at UNK Stalin did not fully realize the dilemma which faced him, that he thought the exclusion of the UNK voters from East European elections would not be greatly resented by his allies, while neither Roosevelt nor Churchill frankly faced "the fact that, in Poland at least, genuinely free democratic elections would return governments unfriendly to UNK by any definition of international UNK Also UNK propaganda and cooperation had UNK the differences between Russian and Western ideas of UNK and it seemed better to have them covered by verbal formulae than to UNK the military victories over Germany and Japan. The application of these formulae could not please both sides, for they really attempted to marry the impossible to the inevitable. While obliged to concede governments in East Europe allied with the Soviet Union instead of opposed to it, we thought we had preserved our social and economic system in East Europe. This illusion was described in a UNK editorial in the <New York Herald UNK on March 5, 1947, in connection with the submission of the satellite peace UNK to the Senate. In doing so Marshall and UNK were UNK for the ratification of a grim lesson in the facts of international life". We had entertained exaggerated ideas about our victory automatically establishing our system throughout the world. UNK were troubled about the fate of the Baltic States. Yalta left us with comforting illusions of a Western UNK political economy UNK supreme up to the Curzon line and the borders of UNK UNK UNK This is a penetrating description of our post-war illusion, which applied to other areas than East Europe. The same editorial continued that "We expected to democratize Japan and Korea and to see a new China pattern itself easily on our institutions. We expected, in short, that most of the world would make itself over in our image and that it would be relatively simple, from such a position, to deal with the UNK aberrations of the Soviet Union". Yet actually "the image corresponded in no way to the UNK of the post-war world. Neither our military, our economic nor our ideological power reached far UNK to determine the fate of East Europe. Then the editorial added UNK "how far they may reach in Asia is yet UNK but they fall far short of our dreams of the war UNK Here is the best short explanation of the origins of the Cold War that has been written. UNK to heed the lesson so clearly contained in the satellite UNK President Truman UNK the Cold War on March 12, 1947, in the Truman Doctrine, exactly one week after the UNK Tribune> editorial was written, and a year after the Cold War had been announced by Churchill at UNK Missouri, in Truman's presence. Then China promptly went UNK and Mr& Truman had to fight the interminable Korean war for the UNK of Korea before we learned how far our writ did UNK in UNK Years of war, strain, and UNK of heavy arms expenditures and constant danger of another world war had to UNK before the United States could bring itself to accept the two chief results of World War /2,- Communist control of East Europe and China. _A NEW UNK OF UNK While the Cold War raged it was easy to blame it all on Yalta. Yet, in UNK a series of careful essays on the Yalta Conference, UNK UNK could find no basis for Yalta becoming "a symbol for betrayal and a UNK for the opponents of Roosevelt and international UNK When the Yalta UNK were finally published with great UNK they had revealed no betrayal by anyone. An analysis of the election falls naturally in four parts. First is the long and still somewhat obscure process of preparation, planning and discussion. Preparation began slightly more than a year after independence with the first steps to organize rural UNK All political interests supported electoral planning, although there are some signs that the inherent uncertainties of a popular judgment led to some UNK The second major aspect of the election is the actual procedure of UNK nomination and voting. UNK technical skill was used and the administration of the elections was generally above UNK However, the UNK differentiated results, which appear below in tables, are interesting evidence of the problems of developing UNK under even the most favorable circumstances. A third UNK and probably the one open to most controversy, is the results of the election. The electoral procedure prevented the ready identification of party UNK but all vitally interested parties, including the government itself, were busily engaged in determining the party UNK of all successful candidates the month following the elections. The fourth and concluding point will be to estimate the long-run significance of the elections and how they figure in the current pattern of internal politics. UNK have figured prominently in nearly every government program and official address since independence. They were stressed in the speeches of UNK UNK UNK when the first Council of Ministers was formed and again when the Istiqlal took a leading role in the second Council. King UNK /5, was known to be most sympathetic to the formation of local UNK and made the first firm promise of elections on May Day, 1957. There followed a long and sometimes bitter discussion of the feasibility of elections for the fall of 1957, in which it appears that the Minister of the Interior took the most pessimistic view and that the Istiqlal was something less than UNK Since the complicated process of establishing new communes and reviewing the rudimentary plan left by the French did not even begin until the fall of 1957, this goal appears somewhat ambitious. From the very beginning the electoral discussions raised fundamental issues in Moroccan politics, precisely the type of questions that were most difficult to resolve in the new government. Until the Charter of UNK was issued in the fall of 1958, there were no guarantees of the right to assemble or to organize for political purposes. The Istiqlal was still firmly united in 1957, but the P&D&I& UNK UNK de UNK the most important minor party at the time, objected to the UNK UNK in the civil service and influence in Radio UNK There were rumors that the Ministry of the Interior favored an UNK UNK process, which were indirectly affirmed when the King personally intervened in the planned meetings. The day following his intervention the palace issued a statement reassuring the citizens that "**h the possibility of introducing appeals concerning the establishment of electoral UNK lists of candidates and finally the holding of the consultation itself **h" would be supported by the King himself. The UNK crisis in the fall of 1957 postponed further consideration of elections, but French consultants were called in and notices of further investigation appeared from time to time. In January, 1958, the Minister of the Interior announced that an election law was ready to be submitted to the King, the rumors of election dates appeared once again, first for spring of 1958 and later for the summer. Although the government was probably prepared for elections by UNK the first decision was no doubt made more difficult as party strife UNK In late 1957 the UNK UNK UNK appeared and in the spring of 1958 the internal strains of the Istiqlal was revealed when the third Council of Government under Balafrej was formed without support from progressive elements in the party. The parties were on the whole unprepared for elections, while the people were still experiencing UNK UNK and suffering the after effects of poor UNK in 1957. Despite the internal and international crises that harassed UNK the elections remained a central issue. They figured prominently in the Balafrej government of May, 1958, which the King was reportedly determined to keep in office until elections could be held. But the eagerly sought UNK of the Balafrej Council of Government was never achieved as the Istiqlal quarreled over foreign policy, labor politics and economic development. By December, 1958, when UNK Ibrahim became President of the Council, elections had even greater importance. They were increasingly looked upon as a means of establishing the new rural communes as the focus of a new, constructive national effort. To minimize the chances of repeating the Balafrej UNK the Ibrahim government was formed <a UNK UNK and a special office was created in the Ministry of the Interior to plan and to conduct the elections. By this time there is little doubt but what election plans were complete. There remained only the delicate task of UNK the laws through the UNK of Palace politics and making a small number of policy decisions. From the rather UNK history of electoral planning in UNK an important point emerges concerning the first elections in a developing country and evaluating their results. In the new country the electoral process is considered as a means of UNK UNK and sometimes UNK differences among leaders and also as a source of policy guidance. In the absence of a reservoir of political consensus each organized political group hopes that the elections will give them new UNK but in a system where there is as yet no place for the less UNK Lacking the respected and effective institutions that consensus helps provide, minority parties, such as the P&D&I& in 1957 and the progressive Istiqlal faction in 1958, UNK for elections when out of power, but are not at all certain they wish to be controlled by popular choice when in power. Those in power tend to UNK and even to UNK the electoral process. The tendency to treat elections as an instrument of UNK rather than an instrument of national interest had two important effects on electoral planning in UNK At the central level the UNK UNK voting system was selected over some form of the UNK de UNK system, even though the latter had been recommended by UNK and favored by all political parties. The choice of the single member district was dictated to a certain extent by problems of communication and understanding in the more remote areas of the country, but it also served to minimize the national political value of the elections. Although the elections were for local officials, it was not necessary to conduct the elections so as to prevent parties from publicly identifying their candidates. With multiple member districts the still fragmentary local party organizations could have operated more effectively and parties might have been encouraged to state their positions more clearly. Both parties and the Ministry of the Interior were busily at work after the elections trying to UNK the political affiliations of the successful candidates and, UNK give the elections a confidential but known degree of national political significance. Since a national interpretation cannot be avoided it is unfortunate that the elections were not held in a way to UNK party responsibility and the educational effect of mass political participation. The general setting of the Moroccan election may also encourage the deterioration of local party organization. The concentration of effective power in UNK leads not only to party UNK but to UNK from local activity that might have had many auxiliary benefits in addition to contributing to more meaningful elections. UNK evidence can be found in the results of the Chamber of Commerce elections, which took place three weeks before national elections. The Istiqlal sponsored U&M&C&I&A& UNK UNK des UNK UNK et UNK was opposed by candidates of the new U&N&F&P& UNK National des Forces UNK in nearly all urban centers. As the more conservative group with strong backing from wealthy UNK the U&M&C&I&A& was generally favored against the more UNK UNK U&N&F&P& The newer party campaigned UNK while the older, more confident party expected the Moroccan merchants and small businessmen to support them as they had done for many years. The local Istiqlal and U&M&C&I&A& offices did not campaign and lost heavily. The value of the elections was lost, both as an experiment in increased political participation and as a reliable indicator of commercial interest, as shown in Table /1,. The chamber of Commerce elections were, of course, an important event in the preparation for rural commune elections. The U&N&F&P& learned that its urban organization, which depends heavily on UNK support, was most effective. The Istiqlal found that the spontaneous solidarity of the independence struggle was not easily transposed to the more concrete, precise problems of internal politics. The overall effect was probably to stimulate more party activity in the communal elections than might have otherwise taken place. A second major point of this essay is to examine the formal arrangements for the elections. Although a somewhat technical subject, it has important political implications as the above discussion of the voting system indicated. Furthermore, the problems and solutions devised in the electoral experiences of the rapidly changing countries are often of comparative value and essential to evaluating election results. The UNK UNK UNK of the elections was naturally an impartial and standardized procedure. As the background discussion indicated there were frequently expressed doubts that a government dominated by either party could fairly administer elections. The P&D&I& and later the UNK Movement protected the UNK UNK UNK until the fall of UNK and then the Istiqlal used the same argument, which it had previously UNK against the UNK tendencies of the Ibrahim government. The bulk of the preparation had, of course, proceeded under the supervision of the Ministry of the Interior, whose officials are barred from party activity and probably generally disinterested in party politics. Apart from some areas of recurring trouble, like UNK UNK where inexperienced officials had been UNK there is little evidence that local officials intervened in the electoral process. UNK however, the administrative problem was more complex and the sheer prestige of office was very likely an unfair advantage. The King decided to remove Ibrahim a week before elections and to institute a UNK Council of Government under his personal direction. Although the UNK had frequently asserted that the elections were to be without party significance, his action was an implicit admission that party UNK were a factor. The new Council was itself UNK of political meaning, which was most clearly revealed in the absence of any U&N&F&P& members and the presence of several Istiqlal leaders. Since the details of the elections were settled the change of government had no direct effect on the technical aspects of the elections, and may have been more important as an indication of royal UNK with the U&N&F&P& UNK preparations began in the fall of 1959, although the actual UNK and planning for the rural communes was completed in 1958. There were three major administrative UNK the fixing of electoral districts, the registration of voters and the registration of candidates. UNK registration began in late November 1959 and continued until early January, 1960. The government was most anxious that there be a respectable response. UNK UNK of the accomplishment in each province made the registration process into a kind of competition among provincial officials. A goal was fixed, as given in Table 2, and attention focused on its fulfillment. The qualifications to vote were kept very simple. Both men and women of twenty-one years of age could register and vote upon presenting proof of residence and identification. There were liberal provisions for dispensation where documents or records were lacking. The police were UNK along with certain categories of UNK citizens, UNK and those punished for UNK activities. The registration figures given in Table 2 must be interpreted with caution since the estimate for eligible UNK were made without the benefit of a reliable census. UNK older workers who have no expectation of securing employment in the occupation in which they are skilled should be able to secure counseling and UNK in an occupation with a future. Some vocational training schools provide such training, but the current need exceeds the facilities. UNK UNK The present Federal program of vocational education began in 1917 with the passage of the UNK Act, which provided a continuing annual appropriation of $7 million to support, on a matching basis, UNK programs of vocational education in agriculture, trades, industrial skills and home economics. Since 1917 some thirteen supplementary and related acts have extended this Federal program. The UNK Act of 1946 raised the previous increases in annual authorizations to UNK million in addition to the $7 million under the Smith Act. The Health UNK Act of 1956 added $5 million for practical nurse training. The latest major change in this program was introduced by the National Defense Education Act of 1958, Title /8, of which amended the UNK Act. UNK authorizations of $15 million were added for area vocational education programs that meet national defense needs for highly skilled UNK The Federal program of vocational education merely provides financial aid to encourage the establishment of vocational education programs in public schools. The initiative, administration and control remain primarily with the local school districts. Even the states remain primarily in an assisting role, providing leadership and teacher training. Federal assistance is limited to half of the total UNK and the state or local districts must pay at least half. The state may decide to encourage local programs by paying half of the cost, or the state may require the local district to bear this half or some part of it. Throughout the history of the program, state government expenditures in the aggregate have usually matched or exceeded the Federal UNK while local districts all together have spent more than either Federal or state governments. Today, Federal funds account for only one-fifth of the nation's expenditures for vocational education. The greatest impact of the UNK principle has been in initially encouraging the poorest states and school districts to spend enough to obtain their full allocation of outside funds. National defense considerations have been the major reason behind most Federal training expenditures in recent decades. During World War /2, about 7.5 million persons were enrolled in courses organized under two special programs administered by state and local school UNK (1) Vocational Education for National Defense, and (2) War Production UNK The total cost of the five-year program was UNK million. For the UNK UNK and National Defense Act of 1958, the cumulative total of Federal expenditures in 42 years was only about UNK million. No comparable measures are available of UNK and expenditures for private vocational education training. There are a great number and variety of private commercial schools, trade schools and technical schools. In addition, many large corporations operate their own formal training programs. A recent study indicated that 85 per cent of the nation's largest corporations conducted educational programs involving some class meetings and UNK Most skilled industrial workers, nevertheless, still acquire their skills outside of formal training institutions. The National UNK Council of Columbia University has estimated that three out of five skilled workers and one out of five technicians have not been formally trained. There is little doubt that the students benefit from vocational education. UNK prefer to hire youth with such training rather than those UNK and most graduates of vocational training go to work in jobs related to their training. Vocational educators do not claim that school training alone makes skilled workers, but it provides the essential groundwork for developing skills. In most states, trade and industrial training is provided in a minority of the high schools, usually located in the larger cities. In Arkansas fewer than 6 per cent of the high schools offer trade and industrial courses. In Illinois about 13 per cent of the schools have programs, and in Pennsylvania 11 per cent. An important recent trend is the development of area vocational schools. For a number of years Kentucky, Louisiana and several other states have been building UNK vocational education schools that serve nearby school districts in several counties. These schools are intended to provide the facilities and specialized curriculum that would not be possible for very small school districts. Transportation may be provided from nearby school districts. UNK are provided mainly for post high school day UNK but sometimes arrangements also are made for high school students to attend, and evening extension courses also may be conducted. The Title /8, program of the National Defense Education Act of 1958 was a great spur to this trend toward area schools. By 1960 there were such schools in all but 4 states. They were operating in 10 of the 17 major areas of chronic labor surplus and in 10 of the minor areas. An extension of this program into the other distressed areas should be UNK UNK TO NEW UNK Some of this trend toward area vocational schools has been related to the problems of persistent labor surplus areas and their desire to attract new industry. The major training need of a new industrial plant is a short period of UNK training for a large number of UNK machine operators. A few key skilled workers experienced in the company's type of work usually must be brought in with the plant manager, or hired away from a similar plant elsewhere. A prospective industry also may be interested in the long-run advantages of training programs in the area to supply future skilled workers and provide supplementary extension courses for its employees. The existence of a public school vocational training program in trade and industry provides a base from which such needs can be UNK Additional courses can readily be added and special cooperative programs worked out with any new industry if the basic facilities, staff and program are in being. Thus, besides the training provided to youth in school, the existence of the school program can have supplementary benefits to industry which make it an asset to industrial development efforts. Few states make effective use of their existing vocational education programs or funds for the purpose of attracting new industry. The opportunity exists for states to reserve some of their vocational education funds to apply on an UNK UNK flexible basis to subsidize any local UNK training programs that my be quickly set up in a community to aid a new industrial plant. UNK UNK OF UNK The major weakness of vocational training programs in labor surplus areas is their focus on serving solely local job demands. This weakness is not unique to labor surplus areas, for it is inherent in the system of local school districts in this country. Planning of vocational education programs and courses is oriented to local employer needs for trained workers. All the manuals for setting up vocational courses stress the importance of first making a <local> survey of skill needs, of UNK the growth of <local> jobs, and of consulting with <local> employers on the types of courses and their content. Furthermore, there is a cautious conservatism on the part of those making local skill UNK Local jobs can be seen and UNK while opportunities elsewhere are regarded as more UNK While the U& S& Department of Labor has a program of projecting industry and occupational employment trends and publishing current outlook statements, there is little tangible evidence that these projections have been used extensively in local curriculum planning. The U& S& Office of Education continues to stress local surveys rather than national UNK This procedure is extremely shortsighted in chronic labor surplus areas with a long history of declining employment. UNK studies have been made in labor surplus areas in order to identify sufficient numbers of local job UNK and future replacement needs for certain skills to justify training programs for those skills. No effort is made in the same studies to present information on regional or national demand trends in these skills or to consider whether regional or national demands for other skills might provide much better opportunities for the youth to be trained. Moreover, the current information on what types of training are needed and possible is too limited and UNK There simply is not enough material available on the types of job skills that are in demand and the types of training programs that are required or most suitable. Much of the available information comes not from the Federal government but from an exchange of experiences among states. UNK State and local agencies in the vocational education field must be encouraged to adopt a wider outlook on future job opportunities. There is a need for an expanded Federal effort to provide research and information to help guide state education departments and local school boards in existing programs. A related question is whether UNK workers can be motivated to take the training provided. There is little evidence that existing public or private training programs have any great difficulty getting students to enroll in their programs, even though they must pay UNK receive no subsistence payments, and are not guaranteed a job. However, there always is some limit to the numbers who will spend the time and effort to acquire training. Again, one major difficulty is the local focus. A training program in a depressed area may have few UNK unless there is some apparent prospect for better employment opportunities UNK and the prospect may be poor if the training is aimed solely at jobs in the local community. If there is adequate information on job opportunities for skilled jobs elsewhere, many more workers can be expected to UNK Another problem is who will pay for the training. Local school districts are hard pressed financially and UNK about vocational training. UNK usually are expanded only when outside funds are available or local business leaders demand it. Even industrial development leaders find it hard to win local support for training unless a new industry is in sight and requests it. State governments have been taking the lead in establishing area vocational schools, but their focus is still on area job opportunities. Only the Federal government is likely to be able to take a long-run and nation-wide view and to pay for training to meet national skilled manpower needs. If only state funds were used to pay for the vocational education, it could be argued that the state should not have to bear the cost of vocational training which would benefit employers in other states. However, if Federal funds are used, it would be entirely appropriate to train workers for jobs which could be obtained elsewhere as well as for jobs in the area of chronic UNK Such training would increase the tendency of workers to leave the area and find jobs in other UNK A further possibility is suggested by the example of the G& I& bills and also by some recent trends in attitudes toward improving college UNK that is to provide financial assistance to individuals for vocational training when local facilities are inadequate. This probably would require some support for subsistence as well as for UNK but the total would be no greater than for the proposals of unemployment compensation or a Youth Conservation Corps. A maximum of $600 per year per student would enable many to take training away from home. A program of financial assistance would permit placing emphasis on the national interest in training highly skilled labor. Instead of being limited to the poor training facilities in remote areas, the student would be able to move to large institutions of concentrated specialized training. Such specialized training institutions could be located near the most rapidly growing industries, where the equipment and job experience exist and where the future employment opportunities are UNK This would UNK possibilities for part-time UNK on-the-job and extension training. Personal financial assistance would enable more emphasis to be placed on the interests of the individual. His UNK and preferences could be given more weight in selecting the proper training. But briefly, the UNK configuration must be examined for its UNK Then the fact that the lower channel line was UNK had further forecasting significance. And then the application of the count rules to the width UNK of the configuration give us an UNK estimate of the probable depth of the decline. The very idea of their being UNK UNK implies that there is some sort of proportion to be expected between the amount of UNK activity and the extent of the UNK UNK up or run UNK movement. This expectation is what really UNK point and figure. But there is no positive and consistently UNK relationship in the UNK sense. Experience will show that only the UNK UNK UNK and in fine, these merely dwell upon a relationship between the UNK and intensities of events. After all, too much does not happen too suddenly, nor does very little take long. The advantages and disadvantages of these two types of UNK bar charting and point and figure UNK remain the subject of fairly good UNK litigation among their respective professional UNK with both methods enjoying in UNK one UNK merit. They are both UNK methods. Even if we strip their respective claims to the UNK minimum, the UNK still favor them both, for the trend in effect is always more likely to continue than to UNK Of course, many more things are UNK besides prices. The foregoing have been methods of charting prices, but now let us look at some of the other indices that are customarily UNK and which are looked to for their forecasting abilities. _THE UNK FOR METHODS_ The search for forecasting formulae is UNK UNK have been worked up between the loading of freight cars and the course of stock price. The theory behind this is, of course, fundamentalist in character. As the number of reported freight car loadings increased, this was taken to indicate increased industrial activity, and consequently increased stock earnings, implying UNK UNK and implying therefore increased stock market prices. We now know that things rarely ever work out in such UNK fashion, and that car UNK while perhaps interesting enough, are nevertheless not the magic formula that will always turn before stock prices turn. But the quest for such an index goes on UNK with all manner of investors and UNK participating, ranging from the UNK institutional type virtually to the UNK UNK operator, all seeking UNK UNK UNK and often UNK for the enchanting index that will UNK the eternal UNK Which way will the market UNK up or UNK It recalls to mind the quest of UNK times for the fountain of youth, a quest heavily invested in, during the days of wooden ships. Just as heavily invested are the endeavors of UNK of modern men who carry on the quest for the enchanting UNK The quest offers UNK Much of this goes on in offices high up in Wall UNK lofty UNK UNK There sit men who make moving averages of weekly volume, monthly averages of price-earnings UNK ratios of the number of advances to the number of UNK ratios of an individual UNK performance to overall market performance, ratios of rising price volume to falling price volume, odd-lot indices, and what not. They are concerned with all things traded in, UNK bonds, UNK coffee, UNK cotton, tin, oats, etc&. And along Chicago's West Jackson UNK La UNK Street, and around the UNK UNK UNK there sit men who chart crop reports, who divide the number of reported UNK by the number of reported UNK and the number of UNK by the amount of UNK They plot the open interest curves, rainfall curves, and they even divide Democratic congressmen by Republican UNK All these things and countless more enter into their UNK and yet, the enchanting index remains UNK UNK at any rate, in the fuller sense of the word. The markets are far too UNK and the last word in these endeavors will doubtless never be written, for the enchanting index is about as UNK as the fountain of youth. But whereas civilized men no longer pursue the UNK they never abandoned their pursuit of the enchanting UNK We mentioned odd-lot indices a few paragraphs ago. In the stock market, the normal trading package is a hundred shares, just as 5,000 bushels is the standard grain contract package. A stock transaction for less than a hundred shares is executed via a special odd-lot UNK on the floor of the exchange. This results in a separate record being made, distinguishing these trades from the overall volume of UNK According to the theory underlying odd-lot indices, the trader who trades odd lots is most likely a small UNK one who can't afford to trade round UNK Or, to use the cynical phraseology of one odd-lot index UNK they represent a sampling of the least sophisticated UNK of traders. UNK most easily prey to an adverse market movement, for this rank of traders can least afford to lose, virtually anything the odd-lot traders do, UNK is taken to UNK the UNK thing to do. Figures reporting the volume of odd-lot purchases and odd-lot sales are released by the stock exchange and carried in the newspapers. UNK index observers then make UNK of the data according to their particular statistical UNK They might, for example, plot it exactly as is, or they might make ten day moving averages of it, or longer moving averages, or they might simply plot the ratio of odd-lot purchases to odd-lot sales. The particular recipe is a matter of individual taste. The data is now interpreted in conjunction with a price chart, usually of a popular stock average. UNK the end of an intermediate or major rise, while the top is forming on the price chart, it is frequently observed that the odd-lot buying increases sharply. This warns the UNK that the formation in progress is quite likely to be a top. Similarly, at the opposite end of the market cycle, towards the end of an intermediate or major decline, usually while the bottom is being formed on the price chart, it is characteristic that an increase is noticed in odd-lot selling again UNK the UNK that a bottom is becoming a greater UNK Thus, in the UNK the odd-lot trader is one who buys at the tops and sells at the UNK UNK occasional individual UNK While it had long been known in general, that "the public is always wrong", the use of odd-lot indices now puts the UNK on a statistical basis. One might well wonder why the "public is always UNK and the question raised is about as awkward as the one concerned with the chicken and the UNK Which came UNK Is it really that the "public" buys at the UNK and not that the market tops out when the "public" UNK And the converse at UNK Does the "public" usually sell at UNK or does the market usually bottom out when the "public" UNK We have been using the word "public" in quotation UNK that is, in its UNK connotation with reference to the odd-lot index theory. Obviously someone has to sell in order for someone to UNK and vice UNK And while all concerned are members of the literal public, somewhat less than all concerned, although still a majority, form the quotation marked UNK And the public minus the "public" leaves the so-called UNK UNK the element on the other end of the UNK UNK This element is often called UNK hands". Strong hands differ from UNK hands" in that their operations are the primary UNK They UNK campaigns, so to speak, even if this initiation is UNK among them, and their concerted action only UNK organized. Strong hands act; weak hands UNK Strong hands move first; weak hands ask, What is going UNK When strong hands UNK they are able to buy more, and they do it even in the face of UNK news reports. They are able to sit more patiently with what they have UNK Needless to say, strong hands are not eager to be joined by weak hands, for this increases the risk that they will have to absorb what these weak hands unload on the way up, at higher prices, during the UNK phase of the campaign. Certain badly UNK market critics are often apt to feel that there is something somehow UNK UNK or even thoroughly criminal about this interplay of competitive forces. But after all, can anyone imagine a market wherein the reverse of these things were UNK Try to imagine a market in which only a minority of traders would lose, and the majority would make consistent profits. How much and how many profits could a majority take out of the losses of a UNK Moreover, the UNK concerning the UNK UNK and its alleged UNK is put to test during every campaign, and UNK only upon UNK not before. It quite often happens that campaigns go UNK resulting in a most UNK deterioration of strong hands into UNK hands, just as a member of a former UNK "public" may emerge UNK "right" the next time. Membership in the UNK UNK too. The study of odd-lot indices is somehow akin to the spectacle of a man trying to UNK his own UNK what with all observers trying to get on the side of the UNK at the same time. The usefulness of this study and of configuration analysis as well, declines in direct proportion to the UNK of its use. It has to, by virtue of the very dictionary definition of the word UNK UNK opposition must persist as to the future course of prices, if there is to persist a market at all. And the few must win what the many lose, for the opposite arrangement would not support markets as we know them at all, and is, in fact, UNK There need be no UNK about admitting this. Anyone still UNK that this is the only way markets can be is invited to try to imagine a market wherein the majority consistently wins what the minority UNK Mr& John UNK whose work has been discussed in this chapter, was quoted in a New Yorker magazine profile as UNK "**h Of course, you have to remember it's a good thing for us UNK that there aren't more of us. If you got too many people UNK by this method, their operations would begin to affect stock prices, and thus throw the charts off. The method would become UNK Mr& Alexander H& UNK Study UNK in Point and Figure UNK tells the UNK "We assure you that the total number of people using this method of market analysis is a very small portion of the sum total of those operating in the securities and commodities UNK What with traders trading for so many different objectives, and what with there being so many unique and individualized market theories and trading techniques in use, and more coming into use all the time, it is hard to imagine how any particular theory or technique could acquire enough UNK to UNK itself. Nevertheless, all theories and techniques lead but to one of two possible modes of expression, if they lead to a market UNK at all. In the final analysis, then, the user becomes either a bull or a bear in a given instance, UNK any amount of UNK and UNK however UNK Thus while his theory or technique may not be UNK it is commonplace for UNK and UNK positions to become temporarily UNK Though the methods of deciding may be profound and UNK the possible conclusions remain but two. #CHAPTER UNK MORE METHODS# _THE UNK The purpose set forth at the beginning of this book was first to introduce the reader to a general background knowledge of the various types and capabilities of the forecasting methods already in use, so that he might then be in a position to evaluate for himself the validity of the rather astonishing empirical correlation that is to follow, and to appraise the forecast that its interpretation suggests for the future of farm prices over the years immediately ahead. IN assessing the outlook for interest rates in 1961, the question, as always, is the prospect for general business activity. By and large, what happens to business as a whole will govern the relationship between demand and supply conditions in the capital markets and will thus determine interest rates. Moreover, the trend of general business activity in 1961 will exert a decisive influence on UNK UNK and other Federal policies which affect interest rates. UNK has been a baffling year for analysts of general business activity. During much of the year the general level of business activity has moved along on a UNK UNK but there have been persistent signs of slack in the economy. The tendency for general business activity to soften somewhat is becoming more evident. Although the pause in the advance of general business activity this year has thus far been quite UNK it is hard to escape the conclusion that the softening process will continue into the first quarter of 1961 and possibly somewhat longer. It is difficult to see any powerful sources of strength on the horizon at this time which would give the economy a new upward UNK The rate of plant and equipment spending by business and industry now seems to be UNK out and facing some decline. In earlier business UNK when this occurred the country usually experienced a sharp upturn in residential construction as mortgage financing became easier to UNK At this time, however, there are signs that increased availability of mortgage credit will not act with the usual speed to stimulate a sharp rise in residential construction. These signs are the inventories of UNK houses in some areas of the country and the moderate rise in vacancy rates for apartments UNK in UNK On the other hand, in a more favorable vein, general business activity should receive some stimulus from rising Federal spending, and the reduction in business inventories has probably run a good part of its course. The 2% increase in retail sales in October to a UNK high is encouraging in this connection as well as the most recent consumer survey by the National Industrial Conference Board, which shows a decided pickup in consumer spending plans. The pattern of general business activity which probably lies ahead of us is a further moderate softening through the spring of 1961 before a new rise in economic activity gets under way. The recovery will probably be UNK by a rising rate of housing starts next spring in response to more readily available mortgage UNK as well as by an expansion of Government spending, well sustained consumer spending, and some rebuilding of business UNK UNK UNK UNK What does the general business outlook suggest about the trend of long-term rates in UNK It suggests that during the next several months, through the spring of 1961, the demand for long-term capital funds may be moderately lower and that interest rates may tend to move a little UNK especially the rates on UNK state, and local bonds, as well as those on publicly offered corporate bonds. However, as witnessed by the large corporate bond calendar at present, as well as the record amount of municipal bond issues approved by UNK the over-all demands for capital funds seem likely to remain high, so that any downward pressure on rates from reduced demand should not be great. It seems UNK moreover, that with an increase in the rate of saving in mortgage lending institutions, interest rates on residential mortgages may move somewhat lower through the spring of next year, although the increased ease in residential mortgage lending may occur primarily in other terms than interest rate, e&g&, easier UNK and amortization terms. If the trend of general business activity follows the pattern suggested here, we are likely to see additional steps by the Federal Reserve authorities to ease the availability of credit. Certainly a further reduction in the discount rate would be a strong possibility, as well as an easier reserve position for the UNK system. However, the monetary authorities will continue to be required to pay attention to the consequences of their actions with respect to our international balance of payments position and the UNK of gold, as well as with regard to avoiding the creation of excessive UNK in the economy, which would delay the effectiveness of monetary policy measures in the next expansion phase of the business cycle. UNK UNK UNK One of the most intriguing questions is whether the recent departures of the Federal Reserve authorities from UNK their open market operations to Treasury bills will spread into UNK Government securities in the next few months. To the extent that the new Administration has its wishes, the Federal Reserve would conduct its open market operations throughout the entire maturity range of Government securities and UNK seek to force down long-term interest rates. The principle of UNK UNK or UNK UNK seems so strongly accepted by the Federal Reserve that it is difficult to envision conditions which would persuade the authorities to depart radically from it by extending their open market purchases regularly into long-term Government UNK However, to the extent that the monetary authorities, in their effort to ease credit in the next several months, conduct their open market operations in UNK Government bonds, they will certainly act to UNK any tendency for long-term interest rates to ease as a result of market forces. By the end of the spring of 1961, assuming that a general business recovery gets under way, interest rates should begin to edge upward again, depending upon the vigor of the recovery and the determination with which the monetary authorities move to restrain credit UNK My guess would be that interest rates will decline moderately into the spring of 1961 and during the second half of the year will turn up gradually to recover the ground lost during the UNK It is pertinent to ask the question: Has the long UNK of interest rates during the past 15 years just about run its course, and are we now entering a period in which both capital market forces and Federal policies will produce a prolonged decline of interest UNK My answer is in the negative because I believe that total capital demands during the Sixties will continue to press against available supplies, and interest rates will generally tend to be firm at high levels. UNK UNK UNK This view is based upon several basic economic forces which I believe will be operating in the Sixties, as follows: _(1)_ Recent events in the General Assembly of the United Nations confirm that the cold war will remain with us, and probably UNK for the foreseeable future. This makes it certain that Federal expenditures for military UNK and foreign economic aid are likely to rise further in the next several years. We are just beginning the task of trying to win or maintain the friendship of the new African nations against the ruthless competition of the Communist bloc. Our efforts to overcome the lead of the Russians in space are bound to mean accelerated Federal spending. Moreover, it is likely that Federal policies aimed at stimulating a faster rate of economic growth of the country, to keep ahead of the Communist countries and to demonstrate that our free economic system is better than theirs, will lead to rising Federal spending in certain areas such as education, housing, medical aid, and the like. There are serious dangers involved in this trend toward rising Federal UNK of which I take a dim view, but it seems very likely to occur. _(2)_ During the Sixties we have the prospect of a significant stepping up in the rate of household formations, which should contribute to a rising volume of consumer expenditures and home building. According to the latest projections of the Bureau of the UNK the annual rate of household formations will increase for the next 20 years. Under the most favorable assumptions for increase, the Bureau of the UNK projects that the annual rate of household formations will rise from about UNK in the last two years of the UNK to an annual rate of about UNK in the first five years of the Sixties, and to a slightly higher annual rate of UNK in the second half of the decade. During the UNK the projections show a more pronounced rise to an annual rate of UNK in the second half of that decade. Accordingly, the expanding markets for consumer goods and housing occasioned by the higher rate of household formation should enhance the general economic prospects of the UNK However, the impact of a rising rate of household formation this decade should not be exaggerated. The average annual rate of UNK in the second half of the Sixties is still considerably below the annual rate of UNK in the three-year period from April 1947 to March 1950. _(3)_ With the expansion of family formation in the Sixties, a continued substantial rise in expenditures by state and local government units seems to be indicated. This is an area in which there is still a large backlog of demand. State and local expenditures (in real UNK increased persistently from UNK in 1949 to UNK in 1959, and it would not be surprising if they showed a comparable increase in this decade, which would carry them to the neighborhood of UNK by UNK Here would be a powerful force for raising business activity. _(4)_ It seems likely that with the three preceding forces at play, the rate of business and industrial plant and equipment expenditures should continue to move upward from the levels of the Fifties. UNK by keen competition in our industrial system, and still further increases in the funds devoted to industrial research, plant and equipment expenditures by business and industry should rise during the decade. _(5)_ In a more pessimistic vein about the economic outlook, I suspect that the reservoir of demand for consumer goods and housing which was UNK during the Thirties and World War /2, is finally in the process of running dry. There is some clear-cut evidence of this. For example, the huge postwar demand on the part of veterans for housing under the ~VA home loan UNK program seems to have largely exhausted itself. Indeed, the failure of UNK as a whole to respond this year to somewhat greater availability of mortgage UNK and the increasing reports of pockets of UNK homes and rising vacancy rates in apartment buildings, may also signal in part that the lush days of big backlog demand for housing are reaching an end. In a way, we may be witnessing the same thing in the sales of automobiles today as the public no longer is willing to purchase any car coming on the market but is more insistent on compact cars free of the UNK which were accepted in the Fifties. The huge backlog of demand which was evident in the first decade and a half after the War was fed by liquid assets accumulated by the public during the War, and even more so by the easier and easier credit in the consumer loan and home loan fields. The consuming public has used up a good part of these liquid UNK or they have been drained by the rising price level, and we have apparently gotten to the end of the line in making consumer or home mortgage terms easier. This is not to say that the level of consumer expenditures will not continue to rise in the UNK I am confident that it will, but consumer spending in the Sixties will not be fortified by the great backlog of wants and desires which characterized most of the Fifties. UNK should become more competitive as consumers become more UNK UNK UNK UNK Accordingly, during the Sixties our national economy is likely to grow at as fast a rate as in the UNK and, in the process, to require enormous amounts of capital funds. UNK policies of industry are the result of a complex of UNK no single explanation has been found which applies to all cases. The purpose of this paper is to analyze one possible force which has not been treated in the literature, but which we believe makes a significant contribution to explaining the wage-price behavior of a few very important industries. While there may be several such industries to which the model of this paper is UNK the authors make particular claim of relevance to the explanation of the course of wages and prices in the steel industry of the United States since World War /2,. Indeed, the apparent stiffening of the industry's attitude in the recent steel strike has a direct explanation in terms of the model here presented. The model of this paper considers an industry which is not characterized by vigorous price competition, but which is so basic that its wage-price policies are held in check by continuous critical public scrutiny. Where the industry's product price has been kept below the UNK and UNK prices due to fears of public UNK the profit seeking producers have an interest in offering little real resistance to wage demands. The contribution of this paper is a demonstration of this proposition, and an exploration of some of its implications. In order to focus clearly upon the operation of this one force, which we may call the effect of UNK UNK on UNK wage UNK we deliberately simplify the model by abstracting from other forces, such as union power, which may be relevant in an actual situation. For UNK purposes, this is best treated as a model which UNK out the conditions under which an important industry affected with the public interest would find it profitable to raise wages even in the absence of union pressures for higher wages. Part /1, below describes this abstract model by spelling out its assumptions. Part /2, discusses the operation of the model and derives some significant conclusions. Part /3, discusses the empirical relevance and policy implications of the conclusions. Part /4, is a brief UNK The UNK Appendix presents the rigorous argument, but is best read after Part /1, in order that the assumptions underlying the equations may be UNK UNK THE UNK OF THE UNK UNK THE UNK The industry with which this model is concerned is a basic industry, producing a substantial share of gross national product. Price competition is lacking. For the purposes of setting the product price, the industry UNK as a single UNK In wage UNK the industry UNK as a unit with a single union. UNK THE DEMAND FOR THE UNK UNK We are concerned with aggregate demand for the industry's product. The manner in which this is shared among firms is taken as given. In any given time period, the aggregate demand for the industry's product is determined by two things: the price charged by the industry, and the level of UNK For the purposes of this discussion, the problem of relative prices is UNK in these two variables, since ~GNP includes other prices. (We abstract here from technological progress and assume that prices of all other products change UNK The form of the industry demand function is one which makes quantity demanded vary inversely with the product price, and vary directly with the level of UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK The industry of this model is so important that its wage and price policies are affected with a public interest. Because of its importance, and because the lack of price competition is well UNK the industry is under considerable public pressure not to raise its price any more than could be justified by cost increases. The threat of effective anti-trust action, provoked by UNK the UNK through price increases not justified by cost increases, and fears of endangering relations with customers, Congress, the general public and the press, all operate to keep price increases in some relation to cost increases. For the industry of this model, the effect of such public pressures in the past has been to hold the price well below the short-run UNK price UNK the wage rate and the level of UNK and even below the UNK price (but not below average UNK For such an industry, it is only UNK to raise its price if such an increase is manifestly UNK by rising costs UNK to rising wages, UNK Thus, if public pressure sets the effective limit to the price that the industry may charge, this pressure is itself a function of the wage rate. In this model, we abstract from all UNK sources of cost changes, so that the UNK UNK <only> rises as the wage rate UNK In such circumstances, it may well be to the advantage of the industry to allow an increase in the basic wage rate. Since marginal costs rise when the wage rate rises, the UNK price also rises when the public-limit price is UNK and is likely to remain well above the latter. The UNK price will also be raised for potential domestic competition, but unless general UNK permits profit margins to increase proportionately throughout the economy, we might expect the public-limit price to approach the UNK price. The UNK price would be approached more rapidly, since domestic UNK do not enter foreign costs directly. Where this approach becomes critical, the industry can be expected to put much emphasis on this as evidence of its sincerity in UNK the wage pressures of a powerful union, requesting tariff relief after it has UNK UNK to the union pressure. Whether or not it is in the industry's interest to allow the basic wage rate to rise obviously depends upon the extent to which the public-limit price rises in response to a basic wage increase, and the relation of this response to the increase in costs accompanying the wage increase. The extent to which the public-limit price is raised by a given increase in the basic wage rate is itself a function of three things: the passage of time, the level of UNK and the size of the wage increase. We are abstracting from the fact of strikes here, but it should be obvious that the extent to which the public-limit price is raised by a given increase in the basic wage rate is also a function of the show of resistance put up by the industry. The industry may deliberately take a UNK not to put pressure on the union, but in order to UNK the government and the customers of the industry. As a strike continues, these parties increase their pressure on the industry to reach an agreement. They become increasingly willing to accept the price increase that the industry claims the wage bargain would UNK Public indignation and resistance to wage-price increases is obviously much less when the increases are on the order of 3% per UNK than when the increases are on the order of 3% per month. The simple passage of an additional eleven months' time makes the second 3% boost more UNK Thus, the public-limit price is raised further by a given wage increase the longer it has been since the previous price increase. UNK however, that the passage of time does not permit the raising of prices <per UNK without an accompanying wage increase. Similarly, higher levels of ~GNP do not, in themselves, provide grounds for raising prices, but they do relax some of the pressure on the industry so that it can raise prices higher for a given wage increase. This is not extended to anticipated levels of UNK however- only the current level of ~GNP affects the public pressure against wage-price increases. Finally, since the public requires some restraint on the part of the companies, larger wage increases call for less than proportionately larger price increases (e&g&, if a wage increase of 5% allows a price increase of UNK a wage increase of 10% allows a price increase of something less than UNK UNK UNK UNK We assume that average total unit cost in the relevant region of operation is constant with respect to quantity produced (the average cost curve is UNK and therefore is identical with the marginal cost UNK and is the same for every firm (and therefore for the UNK The UNK of this average cost is determined by factor prices, technology, and so forth. As we have noted, however, we are abstracting from changes in all UNK of this level except for changes in the wage rate. The level of average cost UNK to marginal UNK is thus strictly a function of the wage rate. UNK UNK UNK AND UNK UNK UNK The single union which faces the industry does not restrict its membership, and there is an adequate supply of labor available to the firms of the industry at the going wage rate. The union does not regard unemployment of its own members as a matter of concern when setting its own wage UNK its concern with employment makes itself felt in pressure upon the government to maintain full employment. The union vigorously demands wage increases from productivity increases, and wage increases to offset cost-of-living increases, but we abstract from these forces here. For our present purposes we assume that the sole subject of bargaining is the basic wage rate (not including productivity improvement factors or cost-of-living UNK and it is this basic wage rate which determines the level of costs. UNK is something of an amorphous concept and the amount of productivity increase in a given time period is not even well known to the industry, much less to the union or to the public. UNK on the amount of productivity increase UNK the problem of agreeing how an increase in profit margins related to a productivity increase should be UNK The existence of conflict and of vigorous union demand for an increase in money wages does not contradict the assumption that the union is willing to settle for cost-of-living and UNK increases as distinct from a UNK increase in the basic wage rate. We assume further that the union recognizes the possibility that UNK increases may offset UNK increases, and it does not entirely disregard the effect of price increases arising from its own wage increases upon the UNK wage rate. For internal political reasons, the union asks for (and UNK increases in the UNK wage rate, and would vigorously oppose a reduction in this rate, but the adjustment of the basic wage rate upwards is essentially up to the discretion of the companies of the industry. Changes in the basic wage rate are UNK and they constitute an argument for raising prices. However, it is not known to either the union or the public precisely how much of a cost increase is caused by a given change in the basic wage rate, although the companies are presumed to have reliable estimates of this magnitude. In this model, then, the industry is presumed to realize that they could successfully resist a change in the basic wage rate, but since such a change is the only effective means to raising prices they may, in circumstances to be spelled out in Part /2, below, find it to their advantage to allow the wage rise. Thus, for UNK changes in the basic wage rate, the industry becomes the active UNK since any increase in the basic wage rate can occur only by reason of industry UNK The presumption in the literature would appear to be that the basic wage rate would be UNK in this case, on the grounds that it is UNK not in the interest of the industry to raise wages UNK From this presumption it is an easy step to the conclusion that any observed increases in the basic wage rate must be due to union behavior different and more aggressive than assumed in our model. It is this conclusion that we UNK we do so by UNK the presumption on which it is based. UNK THE UNK OF THE UNK It is convenient to assume that the UNK contract is of one year's UNK In the century from 1815 to 1914 the law of nations became international law. Several factors contributed to this change. The Congress of Vienna is a convenient starting point because it both epitomized and symbolized what was to follow. Here in 1815 the great nations assembled to UNK not merely for Europe, but for the world. Thus the Congress marks a formal recognition of the political system that was central to world politics for a century. International law had to fit the conditions of Europe, and nothing that could not fit this system, or the interests of the great European nations UNK could possibly emerge as law in any meaningful sense. UNK this imposed two conditions: First, international law had to recognize and be compatible with an international political system in which a number of states were UNK UNK and UNK in their political UNK with one UNK second, it had to be compatible with the value system that they UNK In both respects, international law was UNK It was not always easy to develop theory and doctrine which would square the two conditions. On the one hand, the major European nations had to maintain UNK each other an emphasis upon sovereignty, independence, formal UNK thus insuring for themselves individually an optimal freedom of action to maintain the UNK of UNK that the system required and to avoid anything approaching a repetition of the disastrous UNK experience. But there was no pressing need to maintain these same standards with regard to most of the rest of the world. Thus, theory and doctrine applicable among the great nations and the smaller European states did not really comfortably fit less developed and less powerful societies elsewhere. Political interference in Africa and Asia and even in Latin America (though limited in Latin America by the special interest of the United States as expressed in the Monroe Doctrine, itself from the outset related to European politics and long dependent upon the UNK of UNK system in UNK was necessary in order to preserve both common economic values and the European UNK itself. A nation such as Switzerland could be neutralized by agreement and could be relied upon to protect its UNK more UNK but possible, (with an assist from the UNK was the UNK of the Latin American countries; out of the question was the UNK of Asia and Africa. This UNK of the law was made explicit by a number of 19th century UNK More emphasis was put upon the fact that international law was the law of UNK UNK Kent and UNK the great early American scholars, repeatedly made use of this phrase, or of UNK UNK which is a substantial UNK UNK stated that the public law was essentially UNK to the civilized and Christian peoples of Europe or to those of European UNK Of course it had always been of European origin in fact, but it had maintained a universal outlook under the natural law theory. Now, with virtually every writer, not only was the European origin of public law acknowledged as a historical phenomenon, but the rules thus established by the advanced civilizations of Europe were to be imposed on others. The European customs on which international law was based were to become, by force and UNK the customs that others were to accept as law if they were to join this community as sovereign states. Hall, for example, was quite explicit on this point when he said UNK outside European civilization must formally enter into the circle of UNK countries. They must do something with the acquiescence of the latter, or some of them, which amounts to an acceptance of the law in its entirety beyond all possibility of UNK During the nineteenth century these views were protested by virtually all the Latin American writers, though UNK just as the new nations of Africa and Asia protest them, with more effect, today. A number of other nineteenth-century developments contributed to the transmutation of the law of nations into international UNK that is, from aspects of a universal system of Justice into particular rules governing the relations of sovereign states. The difference is important, for although the older law of nations did cover relationships among UNK this was by no means its exclusive UNK The law of nature governed UNK in their relationship to their own citizens, to UNK and to each other in a UNK unified system. The theory of international law, which in the nineteenth century became common to virtually all writers in Europe and America, broke this unity and this UNK It lost sight of the individual almost entirely and confined itself to rules limiting the exercise of state power for reasons essentially UNK with justice or morality save as these values might affect international relations. No longer did the sovereign look to the law of nations to determine what he ought to do; his search was merely for rules that might limit his freedom of action. To appreciate this development, we must relate it to other aspects of nineteenth-century philosophy. First, and most obvious, was the growing nationalism and the tendency to regard the state, and the individual's identification with the state, as UNK other ties of social UNK National identification was not new, but it was accelerating in intensity and scope throughout Europe as new UNK occurred. It reached its ultimate philosophical statement in notions of UNK UNK put forward by the Germans, especially by UNK although political philosophers will recognize its origins in the rejected doctrines of UNK National identification was reflected UNK in law theories which incorporated this Hegelian abstraction and saw law, domestic and international, simply as its formal reflection. In the international community this reduced law to UNK UNK A state, the highest form of human organization in fact and theory, could be subjected to Law only by a manifestation of UNK or UNK According to the new UNK the nineteenth century corporate sovereign was UNK in a quite new and different sense from his historical UNK He no longer sought to find the UNK he made it; he could be subjected to law only because he agreed to be. There was no law, domestic or international, except that willed by, acknowledged by, or consented to by states. UNK behind Hegelian abstractions were more practical reasons for a changing UNK Related to, but distinguishable from, nationalism was the growth of democracy in one form or another. UNK participation in politics and the demands of various groups for status and recognition had dramatic effects upon law institutions. The efforts of various interest groups to control or influence governmental decisions, particularly when taken in conjunction with the impact of UNK led to a concentration of attention on the legislative power and the means whereby policy could be formulated and enforced as law through bureaucratic institutions. Law became a conscious process, something more than simply doing justice and looking to local customs and a common morality for applicable norms. Particularly was this true when the norms previously applied were no longer satisfactory to many, when customs were rapidly changing as the forces of the new productivity were UNK The old way of doing things, which depended on a relatively stable community with stable ideas dealing with familiar situations, was no longer adequate to the task. First was the period of UNK of existing UNK the Code Napoleon in France and the peculiar UNK that, in fact, resulted from UNK restatement and ordering of the Common Law in England. UNK was followed in all countries by a growing amount of legislation, some changing and adjusting the older law, much dealing with entirely new situations. The legislative mills have been grinding ever since, and when its UNK processes were no longer adequate to the task, a limited legislative authority was delegated in one form or another, to the executive. Whereas the eighteenth century had been a time in which man sought justice, the nineteenth and twentieth have been centuries in which men are satisfied with law. Indeed, with developed UNK the separation of law from justice, or from morality generally, became quite UNK In municipal systems we tend to view what is called positivism as fundamentally a movement to democratize policy by increasing the power of UNK the elected UNK at the expense of the more conservative UNK When the power of the latter was made both limited and UNK when norms were clarified and made more precise and the creation of new norms was placed exclusively in parliamentary UNK two purposes were UNK Government was made subservient to an UNK popular will, and law became a rational system for UNK that will, for serving conscious UNK for UNK the "public UNK It is true that, UNK the task was to remove restrictions that, it was thought, inhibited the free flow of money, goods, and UNK but even UNK was a conscious policy. Law was seen as an UNK of the UNK UNK However, the sovereign was not UNK absolute UNK but rather the parliamentary sovereign of UNK It was, too, an optimistic philosophy, and, though it separated law from morality, it was by no means an immoral or UNK one. Man, through democratic institutions of government and economic freedom, was master of his destiny. The theory did not UNK though it unfortunately might UNK a Hegelian UNK It was merely a UNK and ordering of new institutions of popular government. It was not opposed to either justice or UNK it merely wished to minimize subjective views of officials who wielded public authority. Particularly was this true as UNK capitalism became the dominant credo of Western society. To free the factors of production was a major objective of the rising UNK and this objective required that governmental UNK administrative officials and UNK be limited as precisely and explicitly as possible; that old customs which inhibited trade be UNK that business be free from governmental supervision and notions of morality which might UNK the automatic adjustments of the free UNK that obligations of status that were inconsistent with the new politics and the new economics be done away with. UNK conceived as the free bargain of formal UNK replaced the implied obligations of a more static and UNK society. Indeed, contract was the dominant legal theme of the century, the UNK of the free society. Government itself was based upon UNK business UNK the UNK was analyzed in contractual terms; trade was based on freedom of contract, and money was lent and borrowed on contractual terms; even marriage and the family was seen as a contractual arrangement. It is not surprising that the international obligations of states were also viewed in terms of contract. In fact, UNK UNK is the principle example- went so far as to say that all international law could be traced to the single legal UNK UNK UNK UNK The displacement (at least to a considerable UNK of the ethical UNK of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries by positivism UNK both international law theory and UNK In the first place the new doctrine brought a formal separation of international from municipal law, rejecting the earlier view that both were parts of a universal legal system. One result was to UNK much that had been regarded as the law of nations. UNK law, the law merchant, and the host of problems which arise in private litigation because of some contact with a foreign country were all severed from the older Law of Nations and made dependent on the several national laws. Private international law (which Americans call the UNK of UNK was thus segregated from international law proper, or, as it is often called, public international law. States were free to UNK within broad though UNK UNK limits, their own rules as to the application of foreign law by their courts, to vary the law merchant, and to enact legislation with regard to many claims arising on the high seas. The change was not quite so dramatic as it sounds because in fact common norms continued to be invoked by municipal courts and were only gradually changed by legislation, and then largely in marginal situations. Mr& Justice Black was one of the minority that rested on the Article /1, power. In this view, supported by only three members of the Court, a power denied by the specific provisions of Article /3, was granted by the generality of Article /1,. If this seems UNK its effect was to treat citizens of the District of Columbia equally with citizens of the UNK at the expense of expanding a troublesome jurisdiction. UNK UNK UNK For almost a hundred years we relied upon state courts UNK to review by the Supreme UNK for the protection of most rights arising under national law. Then in UNK apparently in response to the UNK influence of the Civil War, Congress first gave the lower federal courts general UNK UNK with state UNK to decide cases involving UNK questions. One purpose of the change was to attain sympathetic enforcement of rights insured by the Civil War amendments against state interference. UNK difficulty arose with the advent of UNK UNK UNK An UNK presumably designed to deal with the problems of newly freed slaves, became a UNK limitation upon state economic policy. A flood of federal lower court injunctions seriously impeded the processes of local government. Congress reacted with a series of measures modifying in various ways what it had granted in UNK In 1910 it required the UNK of a special UNK court for the issuance of certain injunctions and allowed direct appeals to the Supreme Court. Such legislation was clarified and extended from time to time thereafter. In 1913 an abortive provision was made for the stay of federal UNK proceedings upon institution of state court test cases. The essential UNK of these measures resulted in 1934 in substantial elimination of federal jurisdiction to UNK state public utility rate orders. Three years later similar restraints were imposed upon injunctions against collection of state taxes. This saved for state UNK in the first instance, the two major areas where federal injunctions had been most UNK but other areas remained UNK Meanwhile, the Supreme Court, like Congress, showed misgivings concerning this aspect of government by UNK Drawing upon the traditional discretion of the UNK Mr& Justice Holmes introduced a series of self-imposed judicial restraints that UNK in Mr& Justice UNK famous doctrine of UNK Whereas the earlier cases turned rather narrowly upon the availability of adequate state UNK the new emphasis is upon the nature of the state policy at issue. The classic case is UNK Commission> v& UNK The commission had issued an administrative order which was challenged as UNK against Negroes. Its enforcement was enjoined by a federal trial court. On review the Supreme Court, via Mr& Justice UNK found southern racial problems "a sensitive area of social policy on which the federal courts ought not to enter unless no alternative to **h UNK is UNK An alternative was found in the vagueness of state law as to whether the UNK order had in fact been UNK UNK as usual, to interpret state UNK such interpretation can only be a UNK rather than a UNK Mr& Justice Frankfurter led a unanimous Court to UNK the UNK But it is crucial that here, unlike UNK the trial court was ordered to retain the case until the state courts had had a reasonable opportunity to settle the UNK question. "The resources of equity are equal to an adjustment that will avoid the waste of a tentative decision as well as the friction of a premature constitutional UNK UNK UNK i&e&, UNK is one UNK refusal to UNK is another. To the extent that the jurisdictional principle of UNK stands UNK by subsequent legislation, federal equitable relief against state action must be UNK or so it seems to Mr& Justice UNK In UNK Public Service Commission> v& UNK UNK UNK the commission had refused to permit abandonment of certain UNK train facilities. The UNK claiming UNK of property without due process of law, sought UNK relief. The Court held that federal jurisdiction should not be exercised lest the domestic policy of the state be UNK this in the name of equitable discretion. UNK Frankfurter and Jackson UNK in the Court's result, for they found no merit in the UNK claim. But they objected vigorously to the proposition that federal courts may refuse to exercise jurisdiction conferred in a valid act of UNK "By one fell UNK the Court now finds that Congress indulged in needless legislation in the acts of 1910, 1913, 1925, 1934 and 1937.

In short, congressional power to grant UNK authority to federal courts is now apparently so broad that Congress need not UNK or UNK the right to be UNK The <Lincoln UNK decision UNK a whole new body of federal UNK law" which, as Mr& Justice Frankfurter pointed out in UNK leads to one of the following UNK UNK conflict in federal and state court interpretations of collective bargaining UNK (2) displacement of state law by federal law in state courts **h in all actions regarding collective bargaining UNK or (3) exclusion of state court jurisdiction over these UNK The UNK elaborate examination of the legislative history of the provision in question suggests that Congress' purpose was merely to make unions UNK With a few exceptions, the lawmakers seemed unaware of the technical problems of federal jurisdiction UNK to say nothing of the delegation of UNK power to judges. To avoid these constitutional difficulties, Mr& Justice Frankfurter was prepared to read the Taft-Hartley provision as concerned with UNK rather than federal question, jurisdiction. This would satisfy what presumably was Congress' major UNK the UNK of unions. It would also leave intact the states' traditional authority in the realm of contract law. UNK we have seen, the UNK and UNK decisions require federal courts in diversity cases to follow state UNK UNK Here again Mr& Justice Frankfurter could not lightly accept the principle of wholesale judicial legislation. If Congress wants to displace the states from areas which they have customarily UNK let it do so knowingly and UNK And let it do its own UNK and not leave that to federal judges. Does <Lincoln UNK suggest that if Congress granted jurisdiction over interstate divorce cases, the federal courts would be authorized to fashion a national law for the dissolution of UNK There is a common problem behind most of these federal question and diversity cases. Congress has not clearly defined the bounds between state and federal court competence. It has the power to do so but for the most part has left the matter for solution by judges on a UNK basis. A careful student has suggested that "In any new revision [of the UNK UNK the legislators would do well to remember that the allocation of power to the federal courts should be limited to those matters in which their UNK in federal law might be used, leaving to the state UNK the primary obligation of UNK state law". Obviously, the goal here proposed is the guiding principle in Mr& Justice UNK UNK to the extent that Congress leaves the problem to judicial discretion. The same rule of specialization and division of labor guides him in the UNK UNK cases, in the administrative law area, and indeed in the whole realm of judicial UNK Mr& Justice Black no doubt concurs in principle but is more apt to make exceptions to achieve a generous and UNK result. He will not be UNK by UNK UNK UNK OF STATE UNK With few exceptions, Congress has not given federal courts UNK authority to enforce rights arising under federal law. To put it differently, state and federal courts have concurrent jurisdiction with respect to most claims of federal right. To insure uniformity in the meaning of national law, however, state interpretations are subject to Supreme Court UNK It may be noted, UNK that to UNK UNK an UNK and former southern governor has urged Congress to abolish this reviewing authority. The result, of course, would be that federal law inevitably would mean different things in different states. It would also probably mean different things within the same state- depending upon what court UNK or UNK rendered decision. We consider here only a few of many problems involved in this crucial UNK relationship. The first is that enforcement of national law in state litigation raises in reverse the old diversity puzzle of the relation of procedure to substance. Subject to certain constitutional restraints in favor of fair trials, each level of government is free to devise its own judicial procedures. UNK who choose to assert federal claims in a state court go into that court subject to its rules of procedure. A similar canon applies to those who press state claims in federal UNK e&g&, in diversity cases. In an UNK controversy the state court followed established state procedure by UNK a vague complaint "most strongly UNK the UNK In other words the burden of pleading clearly rested upon the UNK by state law. The result was that the UNK case was UNK Mr& Justice Black led a reversing UNK UNK local rules of pleading cannot be used to impose unnecessary burdens upon rights of recovery authorized by federal law". Here, as in the UNK case, another element of state procedure was UNK to federal UNK law. UNK Frankfurter and Jackson UNK "One State may cherish UNK more than another, one State may be more responsive than another to procedural UNK If a UNK chooses to enforce a Federal right in a State court, he cannot be heard to object if he is treated exactly as are plaintiffs who press like claims arising under State law with regard to the form in which the claim must be UNK the UNK for instance, with which a cause of action must be described. Federal law, though invoked in a State court, UNK the Federal UNK defines what gives a right to recovery and what goes to prove it. But the form in which the claim must be stated need not be different from what the State UNK in the enforcement of like obligations created by it, so long as a requirement does not add to, or UNK the right as defined by Federal law, nor burden the realization of this right in the UNK of UNK Another problem in the area of UNK relationships is this: what constitutes reversible error in a state UNK UNK v& UNK involved a conviction for UNK conduct under a local UNK The conduct in question was a speech. The accused did not object to the trial UNK charge to the jury that UNK UNK constitute a breach of the peace if it stirs the public to anger, invites dispute, brings about a condition of UNK **h". For present purposes it may be assumed that this charge so narrowly limited speech as to violate the federal Constitution. Though the accused raised many other objections, he did not object on this crucial point at any stage of the proceedings. That is, he did not claim in any of the four courts through which his case progressed that the jury charge had denied him any federal right. How else can one explain, for example, allowing the survival of the right to UNK bond discount and premium (section UNK but not the right to UNK bond issue UNK or allowing a deduction for payment of certain obligations of a transferor assumed in the reorganization (section UNK but not a deduction for theft losses sustained by a transferor prior to a reorganization but discovered after it; or requiring a transferor to carry over its method of UNK (section UNK but not allowing rapid amortization of emergency facilities transferred in a UNK or allowing survival of a dividend carryover to a personal holding company (section UNK but not carryover of excess tax credits for foreign UNK These items, and most of the others listed above, seem quite comparable to items whose right of survival is provided for in section UNK There does not seem to be any reasonable basis for distinction either in terms of the nature of the tax attribute or in terms of UNK possibilities. With respect to items such as these the provisions of section UNK viewed in historical perspective, suggest a rule requiring survival, whether the items are beneficial or detrimental to the surviving corporation. To this extent some stretching of the literal meaning of the Committee Report seems justified, since the literal meaning conflicts with the clear UNK if not the language, of the statute. It is not contended that section 381 should prescribe the survival of all of the transferor's tax UNK Such an interpretation could not be justified by a construction of the statute UNK it would certainly violate the intention of Congress as expressed in the Committee UNK and in at least one instance, involving refund claims, it might be contrary to another provision of the United States UNK UNK UNK Section 203 of the United States Code UNK an assignment of a claim against the Government unless made after it has been UNK the amount due has been UNK and a warrant for its payment has been issued. If it were not for judicial development of certain exceptions, this section would UNK a suit for refund by an acquiring corporation for taxes paid by a transferor corporation, even though the reorganization meets the requirements of section UNK A clearly recognized exception is a statutory merger or UNK The leading case, UNK Air Line UNK v& United States,> held that the UNK could sue for a refund of taxes paid by the UNK and it has been consistently followed. The Court said the purpose of the section was principally to spare the Government the embarrassment and trouble of dealing with several parties, one of them a stranger to the claim, and to prevent traffic in claims, particularly tenuous claims, against the Government. Neither reason, said the Court, applied to the case at UNK UNK Congress could not be presumed to have intended to obstruct mergers approved by the states. Other exceptions are assignments for the benefit of UNK corporate UNK transfers by descent, or transfers by UNK UNK are often classified as transfers by UNK of law". A tax-free reorganization not UNK with the merger or consolidation statutes of the states involved is difficult to fit into an UNK of law" mold. Although it is in some ways comparable to a voluntary sale of assets for cash, to which section 203 quite clearly UNK the courts and Treasury have held that acquiring corporations in several types of non-taxable UNK may sue for refund of taxes paid by UNK A recent case in point is UNK UNK v& United States,> in which a claim against the Government was transferred first from a corporation to a partnership, whose partners were former stockholders, and then to another corporation formed by the UNK UNK the final corporation entitled to sue on the claim, the Court cited the UNK UNK UNK and UNK cases for the proposition that "**h transfers by operation of law or in conjunction with changes of corporate structure are not assignments prohibited by the UNK In an earlier case, UNK + Co& v& United States,> an American corporation was formed for the purpose of acquiring the stock of a British corporation in exchange for its own stock and then UNK the British corporation. The UNK statute was held not to prevent the American corporation from UNK for a refund of taxes paid by the British corporation. The transaction presumably would have qualified under section UNK as a contractual UNK followed by a section 332 UNK but not under section UNK as a statutory merger of UNK The Court, nevertheless, relied on the UNK case and also mentioned that the UNK of the two corporations were the same. In substance, said the Court, there was no transfer of equitable title. The Treasury arrives at substantially the same conclusion, but UNK the problem of section 203 of the United States UNK Revenue Ruling UNK provides that if the corporation against which a tax was assessed has since been liquidated by merger with a successor corporation, a claim for refund should be filed by the successor in the name and on behalf of the corporation which paid the tax, followed by the name of the successor corporation. Proper evidence of the liquidation and succession must also be UNK If the succession is a matter of public record, UNK of the UNK of State or other public officials having UNK of the documents will UNK if the succession is not of record, all documents relating to such UNK properly UNK are required. The former proof seems applicable to a statutory merger or UNK the latter to a contractual UNK The Ruling would not, however, apply to an acquisition of assets for cash. A recent UNK although rather UNK cites and follows Rev& UNK UNK The Ruling suggests also that it applies to either a statutory or contractual reorganization. Hence, a successor corporation in a ~C reorganization appears entitled to sue for a refund of taxes paid by the merged corporation despite section UNK In a ~B UNK followed by a section 332 UNK those cases which hold that section 203 is UNK to transfers in liquidation appear to permit the successor corporation to sue for refund of taxes paid by the UNK In fact, a cash purchase of a corporation's stock followed by liquidation might also be an effective way to transfer a claim for refund if the UNK doctrine is not applied to eliminate the intermediate step. These results appear sound. As stated in UNK and numerous other cases, the two primary reasons for the enactment of section 203 of the United States Code were to prevent the Government from having to deal with more than one claimant and to prevent the assignment of UNK claims on a UNK basis. The cases have allowed transfer of claims if beneficial ownership is not changed. The first reason would never apply to a reorganization transfer which meets the conditions of section UNK which is the only type presently under discussion. Section UNK applies only to a transfer by liquidation of a UNK owned to the extent of at least 80 per cent, a statutory merger or UNK an acquisition of substantially all a corporation's assets solely in exchange for voting stock, or a change of identity, form, or place of organization. In virtually every case the transferor corporation is UNK and its former stockholders either own UNK or have a continuing stock interest in, the assets which gave rise to the tax. In these circumstances the possibility of multiple or conflicting claims is exceedingly UNK Furthermore, in a ~C reorganization the continuing interest of stockholders of the corporation which paid the tax must be greater than is necessary in a statutory merger, to which the statute is clearly UNK Nor is it at all likely that a UNK claim against the Government will be assigned on a UNK basis in the guise of a tax-free reorganization. If the transferor has substantial assets other than the claim, it seems reasonable to assume no corporation would be willing to acquire all of its properties in the dim hope of collecting a claim for refund of taxes. If such an unlikely transaction were to take place, it would more logically be accomplished by a stock purchase, followed by the prosecution of the claim by the UNK UNK followed by liquidation. In the rare case where a corporation's only substantial UNK or its most important one, is a claim for UNK perhaps its transfer should not be permitted, whether the reorganization takes the form of a statutory merger or of the acquisition of assets for stock. It UNK then, that although the matter is not dealt with in section UNK a successor corporation in a reorganization of a type specified in section UNK is entitled to sue for refund of taxes paid by a transferor corporation. Section 203 of the United States Code has been interpreted as not applying to claims against the Government transferred in tax-free UNK The successor corporations have been held entitled to sue on such claims. #OTHER TAX UNK OF THE UNK There are certain tax attributes of a corporation whose nature and effect might depend on the facts of the particular reorganization involved. For example, property UNK in the trade or business" of a transferor corporation, as defined in section UNK presumably would not retain its special status following a non-taxable reorganization if it is not so used in the business of the acquiring corporation. The parent of a group filing consolidated returns might be treated as the same corporation following a reorganization defined in section UNK but as a different corporation for this purpose after a tax-free acquisition by another corporation which had not, for example, elected to file consolidated returns with its own UNK Similar considerations presumably made it difficult to prescribe a general rule where the acquired and acquiring corporations have different methods of accounting (section UNK or depreciation (section UNK Other sections of the 1954 Internal Revenue Code provide for survival of certain of a transferor's tax attributes following a tax-free reorganization. Section UNK requires carryover of the transferor corporation's basis for property UNK and section UNK provides for UNK on the transferor's holding period for such property to that of the UNK Section UNK permits a person acquiring UNK facilities to elect to continue amortization over a UNK period. However, a similar privilege was not specifically provided in section 168 for a person acquiring emergency facilities. UNK UNK TO A UNK UNK There may be certain items which are quite similar to a net operating loss carryover or operating deficit and whose right to survive a reorganization should perhaps be subject to the conditions applicable to those items. For example, suppose another excess profits tax similar to prior laws is UNK providing for carryover of excess profits UNK This carryover right has a number of things in common with a net operating loss UNK It is an averaging device intended to ease the tax burden of UNK UNK it is a tax benefit which might be of substantial value to a corporation which expects to have a high excess profits tax. Under the UNK Code this item was permitted to survive a tax-free reorganization in the UNK UNK case, but only over the UNK of Judge UNK Hand, who wrote the majority opinion in the UNK case, a leading case requiring carryover of earnings and profits in a non-taxable reorganization. Since this type of item was not in the statute when section 381 was enacted in 1954, one cannot say with certainty what effect the enactment of that section should have. With respect to this type of UNK one might properly apply the language of the Committee Report, quoted above, which UNK against using section 381 as a basis for treating other tax attributes not mentioned UNK Actually, there do not presently appear to be items in the statute comparable to a net operating loss UNK Probably the primary reason for special treatment of a net operating loss carryover is the unique opportunity it presents for tax UNK UNK REASONS FOR UNK UNK UNK UNK There were two methods that could have been used for conducting the study within the resources available: (1) interviews in depth with a few selected companies, and (2) the more limited UNK of a large number of companies by means of a mail questionnaire. While the method of interviewing a small number of companies was appealing because of the opportunity it might have furnished to probe fully the reasons and circumstances of a company's practices and opinions, it also involved the risk of paying undue attention to the unique and peculiar problems of just a few individual companies. As a result, it was decided that a mail questionnaire sent to a large number of companies would be more effective in determining the general practices and opinions of small firms and in UNK some of the fundamental and recurring problems of defense procurement that concern both industry and government. It was also hoped that responses to a mail questionnaire would suggest fruitful inquiries that might be made in subsequent studies of a more detailed nature. It is recognized that a mail questionnaire has inherent limitations. There is the danger that the questions will mean different things to different UNK Simple UNK or UNK answers do not reveal the different shades of opinion that the various respondents may have. A respondent may want to make alternative answers because he does not know the precise circumstances assumed in the question. There is also the problem of the UNK frame of UNK Is the respondent making a recommendation for his own benefit, for the benefit of his industry, for the benefit of a specific government department or service, for the benefit of the defense program, for the benefit of small business, or for the benefit of the UNK There is also the question of whether the respondent based his answers on factual information and carefully considered judgment, or whether his answers were casual UNK Finally, there is the question of how strongly an expressed opinion is UNK whether it is a firm opinion or one that the respondent favors only slightly over the alternatives. The research team was very mindful of these dangers and limitations of a mail questionnaire. Under the circumstances, however, the team considered it would provide the most useful information at this point. In the preparation of the questionnaire the problems noted above were carefully considered, and the structure and phraseology used were designed to minimize the effects of these limitations. UNK UNK OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE# The questionnaire was designed to elicit three types of UNK (1) the facts regarding certain characteristics of the UNK including their experience with, and interest in, securing defense business; (2) the actual selling and buying practices of the UNK and (3) the attitudes and opinions of the respondents concerning bidding procedures and the methods of awarding defense contracts. It was hoped that the facts concerning the characteristics and practices of the respondents would offer clues to the reasons why they took the positions and made the recommendations which they did. The major sections of the questionnaire (see Appendix UNK are devoted to the following: _1._ Information for UNK respondents (Part ~A of the questionnaire) _2._ UNK of defense sales activities (Part ~B of the questionnaire) _3._ Respondents' practices in participating in advertised bidding for defense business (Part ~C of the questionnaire) _4._ Respondents' practices in participating in negotiated bidding for defense purposes (Part ~D of the questionnaire) _5._ Respondents' opinions regarding advertised bidding (Part ~E of the questionnaire) _6._ Respondents' opinions regarding negotiated bidding (Part ~F of the questionnaire) _7._ Respondents' preferences regarding the methods of awarding defense contracts (Part UNK of the questionnaire) The questionnaire provided a place for the name of the respondent but stated that identification of the respondent was UNK The questionnaire also stated that, in any event, all replies would be treated UNK It is interesting to note that 75 per cent of those who returned the questionnaire identified themselves. UNK UNK AND UNK OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE# The research team prepared and then revised the questionnaire over a period of six months. In June, 1960, an early draft of the questionnaire, along with a cover letter, was mailed to fourteen companies in the state of Washington. Several days after the companies had received the questionnaire, members of the research team contacted the presidents of eleven of these companies in person or by phone to discuss any ambiguities or difficulties the UNK might have experienced in completing the questionnaire. This test resulted in further revisions of the questionnaire. The research team was concerned that responses from firms in the state of Washington might not be typical of those throughout the country, or that the results might be different when no phone or personal follow-up was made. Accordingly, another test of the UNK was made. The revised draft was mailed in July, 1960, to 100 firms throughout the United States. Fifty of the 100 firms were selected on a random basis from UNK names submitted by member companies of the Aerospace Industries Association UNK UNK and fifty were selected in a similar manner from a list of 1,500 names compiled by the research team from the Thomas Register UNK UNK The method of compiling the ~AIA and ~TR lists will be described later. Ten days after the questionnaires were mailed, follow-up airmail UNK were sent urging those companies which had not yet returned their questionnaires to do so at once. UNK returns in all were received. The responses were carefully checked for obvious errors in the answers or for questions that were apparently not understood by the UNK The cover letter, questionnaire, and follow-up postcard were then revised into final form (see UNK ~A, ~B, and UNK UNK UNK OF UNK UNK The objective of the study was to determine the opinions and practices of small firms selling to defense programs. The firms to receive the questionnaires were selected with this objective in mind. Three lists of companies were made and used in the study. The first was a list of fourteen manufacturing companies located in the state of Washington which were personally known to the research team to be active in defense work. The primary consideration in the compilation of this list was convenience in discussing the questionnaire with company officers. The second list was derived from a group of approximately 8,000 names supplied to the research team by the Aerospace Industries Association. These names were secured from member companies by the Association from the forty-four sources listed in Appendix ~F. Each source selected from its approved UNK list about 200 firms which it believed to be small businesses that participated in the production of weapons and weapon support systems. Where possible, the name of an executive was supplied along with the company name and address. The forty-four lists supplied by the ~AIA member companies were merged and duplicate names were eliminated. There was further elimination of all companies that were not accompanied by the name of a responsible company executive. The remaining names were then checked against the Thomas Register list (see UNK and duplicate names were removed from the ~AIA lists. By these steps the final ~AIA list was reduced from 8,000 to UNK The third list was selected by the research team on a random basis from the Thomas UNK It was compiled as a control sample to determine if the opinions and practices of companies on the lists submitted by the members of the Aerospace industries Association were materially different from those of other small firms selling to defense programs. Such a difference might have resulted UNK _1._ The fact that the Aerospace Industries Association members whose lists were used did not comprise all firms engaged in defense programs. _2._ The fact that companies on the ~AIA lists were already participating in the defense program because of the manner of their selection. Accordingly, as UNK they might have different opinions and practices than an UNK composed of those companies not so participating but interested in defense business. _3._ The fact that ~AIA lists might not have been selected on a random basis. The control sample was selected by taking the bottom name of each of the two columns of names on each page of the alphabetical listing of manufacturers in the Thomas UNK If the bottom name in each column did not have a responsible executive identified, the next name above which identified such a responsible executive was UNK Fifteen hundred names were selected in this fashion. UNK UNK THE QUESTIONNAIRE# Each questionnaire was mailed with a cover letter addressed personally to the president or other executive of each firm. The questionnaires were mailed in Seattle, Washington, and sent by regular mail to addresses in the states of UNK UNK Oregon, and Washington. UNK was used for the addresses outside the Pacific Northwest. Each letter contained a UNK return envelope by regular mail for addresses in the Pacific UNK and by airmail for those outside the Pacific Northwest. Approximately ten days after the questionnaire was mailed, a follow-up airmail postcard was sent to each of the original names. The first test mailing (to 14 UNK was made in June, 1960. The second test mailing (to 100 UNK was made in July, 1960. The final mailing of the questionnaire was made late in August, 1960, to UNK firms consisting of UNK from the ~AIA list and UNK from the ~TR list. UNK UNK UNK Over 1,000 returns were received within two weeks after the final mailing was made. They continued to arrive until the end of December, 1960, by which time a total of UNK returns were received representing UNK per cent of the UNK questionnaires sent out. UNK returns could not be used because they were incomplete or received too late to be UNK The remaining UNK returns that were processed came from the categories in Table 2. UNK UNK THE UNK Each questionnaire was UNK for obvious mistakes and for comments, and was identified by a serial number, by the source list from which the company name was selected, and by the geographical location of the company as determined by the UNK on the return UNK All UNK except comments, were UNK UNK to permit use of UNK equipment. The codes were UNK into ~IBM punch cards and UNK Each return required three cards and involved key UNK UNK digital columns. In order to be able to properly relate the data for a single company each of the three cards comprising the set for each firm was identified with the appropriate serial number of the UNK The cards were then processed using standard ~IBM punch card equipment, including an ~IBM UNK computer. The first step in processing was to analyze the returns from Questions 1, 2, and 3 to determine whether the respondents were large businesses or small businesses, in accordance with the definitions contained in UNK Section UNK (see Chapter UNK The results are shown in Table 3. The returns from companies classified as large businesses were set aside and not used because they were not relevant to a study of the opinions and practices of small firms. The second step in processing was to compare the responses from companies on the ~AIA list with those from companies on the ~TR list in order to determine whether it would be appropriate to merge the responses for the purposes of the study. The methods and results of this comparative analysis are described in Appendix ~H. It was concluded that it would be appropriate to process the two groups of responses as a single sample of all small businesses engaged in, or UNK to sell to, defense programs. In the first place, the two groups of firms, when UNK had characteristics and practices that were more representative of companies that were the subject of this study than did the firms from the ~AIA list alone. THE vast Central Valley of California is one of the most productive agricultural areas in the world. During the summer of 1960, it became the setting for a bitter and basic labor-management struggle. The contestants in this economic struggle are the Agricultural Workers UNK Committee UNK of the UNK and the agricultural employers of the State. By virtue of the legal responsibilities of the Department of Employment in the farm placement program, we necessarily found ourselves in the middle between these two forces. It is not a pleasant or easy position, but one we have UNK to UNK We have sought to be strictly neutral as between the parties, but at the same time we have been required frequently to rule on specific issues or situations as they UNK UNK one side was pleased and the other UNK regardless of how we ruled. Often the displeased parties interpreted our decision as implying favoritism toward the other. We have UNK ourselves with the thought that this is a normal human reaction and is one of the consequences of any decision in an adversary UNK It is UNK nevertheless, to read in a labor UNK UNK knuckles down to UNK and then to be confronted with a UNK publication which states, UNK recognizes obviously phony and UNK strikes as UNK UNK For a number of years, there have been sporadic attempts in California to organize farm workers. These attempts met with little UNK for a variety of reasons. They were UNK UNK without experienced leadership, and lacked the general support of organized labor as a whole. This past year the pattern has been UNK The organizing program had the full support of the ~AFL-~CIO, which supplied staff and money to the UNK as well as moral support. UNK was experienced and UNK and financial resources were significant. Regardless of where personal sympathies may lie as between the parties, failure to recognize these changed conditions would be to ignore the facts of life. As a result of these changed conditions, the impact of the organizational effort on agricultural labor-management relations has been much greater than in the past. The ~AWOC has been able to employ the traditional weapons of UNK the strike and the picket UNK with considerable success, particularly in the area of wages. By the very nature of the situation, it is the union which has been able to select the time and place to bring pressure upon management. To date, at least, the strategy of the ~AWOC has been UNK that is to say, to concentrate on a particular crop or activity in a particular area at a strategic time, rather than any broadside engagement with management throughout an area or the State. UNK we became involved in these disputes because of our referral obligations under our farm placement program. UNK because agricultural labor is not covered by unemployment insurance, we would not expect any issues to arise regarding benefit payments under the trade dispute provision of the UNK Insurance Code, although such a situation is quite within the realm of possibility. But the current issues arose out of the Wagner-Peyser Act concerning referrals to an establishment where a labor dispute exists, and out of Public Law UNK and the UNK Labor Agreement if Mexican nationals were employed at the ranch. Most of us remember and think of the Wagner-Peyser Act in its historical sense, as a major UNK in the development of public placement services. UNK do we think of it as a living, UNK operating control over the system. However, when labor disputes arise, its provisions come clearly into play. California has accepted the provisions of that Act (as have all other UNK by enacting into our Code UNK UNK a provision that <The State of California accepts the provisions of the Wagner-Peyser Act, **h and will observe and comply with the requirements of that UNK With respect to labor UNK the Wagner-Peyser Act states only, <In carrying out the provisions of this Act, the Secretary is authorized and directed to provide for the giving of notice of strikes or UNK to applicants before they are referred to UNK Other provisions of the Act UNK the Secretary to adopt regulations necessary to carry out its UNK and he has done so. The pertinent regulation for our purposes is Section UNK UNK as follows: UNK in labor dispute situations. UNK person shall be referred to a position the filling of which will aid directly or indirectly in filling a job which (1) is vacant because the former UNK is on strike or is being locked out in the course of a labor dispute, or (2) the filling of which is an issue in a labor dispute. With respect to positions not covered by UNK (1) or (2) of this paragraph, any individual may be referred to a place of employment in which a labor dispute exists, provided he is given written notice of such dispute prior to or at the time of his UNK In analyzing this UNK let us take the last sentence first. It permits referrals under certain circumstances even when there is a labor dispute, provided the individual is given written notice of such a dispute. UNK for example, a situation where a farm has a packing shed and fields. The packing shed workers go on strike. There is no dispute involving UNK We concluded that we may refer workers to the UNK (but not the packing shed UNK provided we give them written notice of the packing shed dispute. So far, no troublesome cases have arisen under this UNK It is the first part of the Regulation that is currently at issue. Note that it UNK referrals under either condition (1) or condition UNK UNK representatives have contended that the Secretary has gone beyond his authority by such a UNK on the grounds that the Wagner-Peyser Act requires only written notice to the prospective worker that a dispute exists. UNK UNK The matter got into the courts this way: One of the early strikes called by the ~AWOC was at the UNK UNK orchards in UNK County. We found that a labor dispute UNK and that the workers had left their jobs, which were then vacant because of the dispute. Accordingly, under clause (1) of the Secretary's UNK we suspended referrals to the UNK UNK no Mexican nationals were UNK The UNK seeking to continue his UNK challenged our right to cease referrals to him, and sought relief in the Superior Court of UNK County. The court issued a temporary restraining order, directing us to resume UNK We, of course, UNK the court order. However, the Attorney General of California, at the request of the Secretary of Labor, sought to have the jurisdiction over the issue removed to the Federal District Court, on grounds that it was predominantly a Federal issue since the validity of the Secretary's Regulation was being UNK However, the Federal Court held that since the State had accepted the provisions of the Wagner-Peyser Act into its own Code, and presumably therefore also the regulations, it was now a State matter. It accordingly refused to assume UNK whereupon the California Superior Court made the restraining order UNK Under that order, we have continued referring workers to the ranch. A similar case arose at the UNK ranch in UNK County, and the Superior Court of that county issued similar restraining orders. The UNK have UNK argued that I should have accepted the Superior Court decisions as conclusive and issued statewide instructions to our staff to ignore this provision in the Secretary's UNK I cannot accept that view, either as a lawyer or as an UNK UNK UNK First, let us examine briefly some of the legal considerations involved. It is an accepted UNK principle in California that a Superior Court decision does not constitute a binding legal UNK It is UNK unless UNK only upon the particular parties to the particular action which was heard. It is not binding upon another Superior Court, which could rule to the contrary. Only when a decision is rendered by the District Court of Appeal (or, of course, the Supreme UNK is a binding precedent established. In that event, we can correctly say that we have received an authoritative interpretation of the matter, and one which we can follow statewide with confidence that the policy will not be UNK in other Superior UNK But over and beyond the compelling need for a binding precedent decision, I am convinced that the decisions of the Superior UNK which in effect UNK the Secretary's Regulation are not a correct interpretation of the Secretary's power under the Federal law. I believe I am in good company in this view. The Attorney General of California concurs in this interpretation and has filed an appeal from these decisions to the District Court of UNK The Attorney General of the United States, in considering the power of the Secretary to issue similar regulations under the Wagner-Peyser Act relating to the interstate recruitment of farm workers, has rendered an opinion UNK his authority. Further, and as an evidence of legislative intent only, the Senate of the United States recently defeated by a substantial majority the UNK UNK to the Fair Labor UNK Act, which would have specifically limited the regulatory authority of the Secretary in these matters. Next, let us consider briefly the program and administrative implications of a failure on our part to pursue our UNK There is far too much at stake for all of the parties concerned to leave the matter hanging in UNK The ramifications of the issue are enormous. A decision to refer workers to jobs vacant because of a strike would have to be applied equally to UNK situations, and might in effect place the public employment services in the position of acting as UNK The public interest is so dominant in such an issue that I cannot be so presumptuous as to attempt to settle it by an administrative order based upon conclusions reached in a summary action in one or two Superior UNK in the State. It is an issue which may well reach the Supreme Court of the United States before judicial finality is achieved. As an administrator, I cannot place the Employment Service in California in UNK of being out of compliance with the Federal laws by my failure to pursue the avenues of appeal open to me. To have applied statewide the decisions of the two cases heard in Superior Court, in my opinion, would have placed us clearly out of compliance with the Wagner-Peyser Act and would have immediately opened the way for the Secretary of Labor, were he so UNK to notify the Governor of such UNK set a date for hearing, and issue his UNK The impact of UNK under the Wagner-Peyser Act is clear: the withdrawal of some UNK million a year of administrative funds which finance our employment service program or, as a UNK the taking over by the Federal Government of its operation. Thus far, the cases which have come before the courts have involved only the issue of referral where the job is vacant due to a strike- condition (1) in the Regulation of the Secretary. None has yet arisen under condition UNK relating to referral to jobs "the filling of which is an issue in a labor UNK Here the problem is essentially one of defining the word UNK Should it be defined in a narrow sense to include only such elements as job UNK union membership, union UNK and the UNK Or should it have a broader connotation of including wage demands and other factors not necessarily associated with the mechanics of UNK the job. Because of the uncertainty of this definition, I UNK the interpretation of the Secretary of UNK He has advised me that the narrower interpretation is the proper UNK that is, that if wages, for example, is the only issue in a labor dispute, and no workers have left their jobs because of the dispute, we may continue to make UNK _9._ Martin and UNK present evidence that infants and young children can and do solve many problems at a relatively simple perceptual level simply by combining objects and counting them. After they have developed UNK they are free from the necessity of UNK objects; they do symbolically what they once had to do UNK The ability to think seems to increase consistently with age. One experiment showed the greatest UNK difference occurring between the eleventh and twelfth years. _10._ Many studies indicate that elementary-school children's interests cover the whole field of UNK that their questions indicate a genuine interest in social processes and UNK and that as they mature their interests and capabilities change and UNK UNK UNK How a child feels about himself, about other people, and about the tasks confronting him in school may have as much influence on his success in school as his physical and intellectual characteristics. A considerable amount of evidence exists to show that an unhappy and insecure child is not likely to do well in school subjects. UNK maturity is the result of many factors, the principal ones being the experiences of the first few years of the child's life. However, the teacher who understands the influence of emotions on behavior may be highly influential in helping pupils gain confidence, security, and satisfaction. Concerning this responsibility of the teacher, suggestions for helping children gain better control of the emotions are presented in Chapter 11. The following generalizations about the emotional characteristics of elementary-school children may be helpful. _1._ Typically, the young child's emotional reactions last for a relatively short time, as contrasted to those of an UNK _2._ As the child grows older, his emotional reactions lead to UNK or emotional states drawn out over a period of time and expressed slowly, rather than in short, abrupt UNK _3._ Studies of the growth and decline of children's fears indicate that fears due to strange objects, UNK falling, and unexpected movement decline during the UNK years, but that fears of the dark, of being alone, and of imaginary creatures or robbers increase. _4._ UNK a child for being afraid or forcing him to meet the feared situation alone are poor ways of dealing with the problem; more effective solutions include UNK the example of another child, or conditioning by UNK the feared object, place, or person with something pleasant. _5._ Children need help in learning to control their emotions. The young child learns from parents and teachers that temper UNK screaming, UNK and hitting will not get him what he UNK the older child learns that intense emotional UNK will not win approval by his UNK and, therefore, makes a real effort to control his emotions. _6._ Children differ widely in their emotional responses. Among infants the patterns of emotional responses are UNK as the influence of learning and environment are felt, emotional behavior becomes UNK UNK UNK Although no national norms exist for the social development of children, the teacher can find a great deal of information concerning types of social behavior normally displayed by children at various age levels. The following summary will give the student some idea about the social characteristics of elementary-school children; the student will certainly want to explore more deeply into the fascinating study of immature individuals, struggling to meet their developmental needs, and at the same time trying to learn the rules of the game in the ever-expanding number of groups in which they hold membership. _1._ During early childhood, children are more interested in the approval of their parents and teachers than they are in the approval of other children; after they have been in school a few years, their interest in UNK of their own age increases, and their interest in adults UNK the child who had once considered it a treat to accompany his parents on UNK and family gatherings now considers it a UNK In late childhood the influence of the group on the social behavior of the child continues to UNK the group sets the styles in clothing, the kind of play engaged in, and the ideals of right and wrong behavior. _2._ In early childhood the choice of a companion is likely to be for another child of his own age or a year or two older, who can do the things he likes to do; such factors as sex, intelligence, and status in the group do not influence his choice much at this time. _3._ In later childhood, an interest in team games replaces individual UNK loyalty to the group, a feeling of superiority over those who are not members, and unwillingness to play with members of the opposite sex become dominant UNK _4._ During early childhood boys tease and UNK on the average, more than UNK those who feel inferior or insecure engage in these activities more than do UNK children. _5._ During late childhood boys like to UNK UNK and talk smart to UNK girls, who are more mature than boys, UNK upon the youthful antics of boys of their own age. _6._ By the time pupils reach the sixth grade, their ethical and moral standards are fairly well UNK they exhibit a keen interest in social, political, and economic problems, but they frequently have vague and incorrect notions about the terms they use rather glibly in their routine school work. _7._ Between the ages of two and four years, UNK or resistance to adult authority is UNK after the fourth year it begins to decline. However, as we have seen, in later childhood the child begins to substitute the standards of the peer group for those of parents and teachers. _8._ The elementary-school child grows gradually in his ability to work in groups. The child in the primary grades can play UNK with one UNK but his desire to be first in everything gets him into trouble when the group gets UNK he wants to be with people, but he hasn't yet learned to UNK In the middle grades, however, he begins to participate more effectively in group activities such as selecting a leader, helping to make plans and carry on group activities, and setting up rules governing the enterprise. #WHY THE UNK SHOULD UNK THE INDIVIDUAL UNK Much progress has been made in the last two decades in developing techniques for understanding children, yet in almost any classroom today can be found children whose needs are not being met by the school program. Some are failing to achieve as much as their ability would UNK others never seem able to enter fully into the life of the classroom. These children have been described as those who were trying to say something to adults who did not understand. Many school systems now employ school psychologists and child guidance UNK These specialists perform valuable services by helping teachers learn to identify children who need special attention, by suggesting ways of meeting the needs of individual children in the regular UNK and by providing clinical services for severely maladjusted children. It is the classroom teacher, however, who has daily contacts with UNK and who is in a unique position to put sound psychological principles into practice. Indeed, a study of the individual child is an integral part of the work of the elementary-school teacher, rather than merely an additional UNK Teachers and administrators in many elementary schools have assumed that dividing the pupils in any grade into groups on the basis of test scores UNK the problem of meeting the needs of individuals. What they should recognize is that children who have been placed in one of these groups on a narrow academic basis still differ widely in attributes that influence success, and that they still must be treated as individuals. Although the teacher must be concerned with maintaining standards, he must also be concerned about understanding differences in ability, background, and experience. UNK THAT UNK UNK AND UNK TO UNK Studies conducted in various sections of the United States indicate that many children in elementary schools are maladjusted UNK and that many of them are failing to make satisfactory progress in school subjects. One study, which involved UNK pupils in grades one to six, found that 12 percent of the pupils were seriously maladjusted and that 23 percent were reading a year below capacity. It is UNK therefore, that the teacher needs to know what factors have a vital bearing on the learning and adjustment of children. When a child fails to meet the standards of the school in his rate of learning, UNK UNK and other forms of maladjustment frequently follow. These UNK in turn inhibit learning, and a vicious cycle is completed. It is easy for the teacher to rationalize that the child who is not achieving in accordance with his known ability is just plain lazy, or that the child who lacks interest in school, who UNK the teacher, or who is UNK is a hopeless UNK The causes of retardation and maladjustment may be found in physical factors, such as defective speech or hearing, impaired vision, faulty motor UNK a frail UNK chronic disease, UNK and UNK UNK They may be caused by poor health UNK such as faulty eating and sleeping habits. They may be related to mental UNK or lack of aptitude for certain types of school work. The curriculum may be too difficult for some and too easy for others. Teaching methods, learning materials, and promotion policies may inhibit learning and lead to UNK for some children. UNK family relations, broken homes, and undesirable community influences may also be contributing factors. This is only a minimum list of the factors that inhibit learning and contribute to maladjustment among children. Moreover, these conditions do not influence all children in the same manner. A vision UNK that may produce nervous tension and reading disability for one child may spur another child on to even greater achievement in reading. An impoverished home that may discourage one child may constitute the motivation causing another to work harder for successful achievement in school. At any rate, the teacher who recognizes common causes of retardation and maladjustment can frequently do a great deal to eliminate the causes of pupil UNK failure, and UNK UNK OF UNK UNK CHILDREN# UNK teaching involves getting enough information about each pupil to understand why he UNK as he does in certain situations and how his achievement in school is being influenced by various factors in his environment. The classroom teacher cannot be expected to be as proficient in the use of the techniques of child study as the clinical UNK he cannot be expected to administer all the tests and gather all the information needed about each child in his classroom. He can be expected, however, to examine and interpret the information already UNK to refine and extend his own techniques for studying individual children; and to utilize opportunities, arising in connection with regular classroom activities, for gaining a better understanding of his pupils. This section deals with some of the sources of information that can be tapped by the classroom UNK Chapter 15 provides more detailed information about specific techniques used in evaluating pupil progress. UNK UNK Most school systems today maintain a system of cumulative records of pupils. These records, when systematically UNK provide much information about the children, which the teacher can use in guidance, UNK UNK and reporting to parents. Each teacher has in his classroom a metal file, equipped with a lock, which is used to store cumulative record UNK During summer vacation periods these records are stored in the office of the UNK Only the teacher and other professional personnel are permitted to see or use these records. Each new teacher to whom the pupil goes is expected to study the information in the cumulative record and to bring it up to date. Some school systems provide written instructions to principals and teachers designating when certain information is to be recorded on cumulative record forms and explaining how the information is to be summarized and used. THE UNK REPORT ON UNK UNK IN UNK IN THE UNK UNK UNK clearly shows two pieces of information. The Summary Report, which was prepared for this Conference, indicates, first, that actual or pending school desegregation is UNK second, that both actual and pending desegregation is, with few exceptions, the product or result of court order. The Report together with other information suggests that desegregation in the schools is slow. The UNK UNK as defined by the National Association of UNK Relations Officials UNK consists of the states of Kentucky, Maryland, Tennessee, West Virginia, Delaware, Virginia and the District of Columbia. The states and the Nation's Capital all have some UNK in fact some dating back to UNK but the region also embraces some of the staunchest opposition. Desegregation has been opposed by massive resistance, UNK pupil assignment (with no assignments of Negro UNK and hate UNK UNK AND UNK UNK Now let's look at the evidence that shows the increase in desegregation and such increase as a result of court order. First UNK Elementary school desegregation came to Owen and Union UNK which already had high school desegregation. The action was a result of a court order, the citation for which (and for other court action mentioned in this UNK is taken from the Summary Report for this UNK In UNK the UNK County Board of Education had prepared a desegregation plan which the Court approved but which a plaintiff had UNK thus, county school board and Federal court joined hands here to promote school desegregation. Additional school desegregation in UNK resulted from a court order opening a school serving children of military personnel. Similarly, further desegregation may come from suits pending in three Tennessee cities, UNK UNK and UNK In UNK UNK the number of white and Negro children attending the same school has increased almost UNK There are no court decisions here. As in Maryland, a District court has approved an official plan of school desegregation in UNK As a result of the State Board of Education plan, Negro children entered heretofore white elementary schools in five districts. The Third Circuit Court of Appeals is reviewing an appeal from the plan. In UNK court orders led to desegregation in UNK and UNK UNK Desegregation in UNK County is pending because of court order, although date of admission is not yet determined. Negro parents have filed application for admission of additional children to schools in UNK UNK UNK and Warren UNK Desegregation can also result from additional suits brought by Negro plaintiffs against school boards in Newport UNK UNK County, Arlington County, and UNK As a school district, the UNK of UNK has had desegregated schools since 1954, shortly after the Supreme Court decision. This UNK makes it clear that school desegregation continues, including the Old UNK State, in spite of its stern resistance. The record is clear that increase in school desegregation last year came largely as a result of a court UNK that on the immediate UNK if further large-scale UNK UNK desegregation comes, it will result from court orders on suits filed in several UNK states. UNK that thousands of school districts are involved and observation that school desegregation has occurred in only a handful in UNK leads to a conclusion that UNK is slow. Before turning to my views as to the problems and issues before us at this Regional Conference, I wish to note a small item in the Summary Report as it refers to the District of Columbia. That reference in the Report is UNK of the trend toward an all-Negro school UNK a remark apparently occasioned by the increase of Negro school population from UNK per cent to UNK per cent. I see no real prospects for an all-Negro school population. West of Rock Creek Park is still UNK white and is in fact increasingly white as a result of UNK UNK housing program. UNK UNK UNK is UNK Negroes. The large acreage in the Southwest Redevelopment area UNK white people- what with high-priced town houses and elevator apartments. The Capitol Hill UNK like UNK Bottom, replaces Negroes with whites (but also replaces some whites with other UNK The UNK break with tradition, the past and present of UNK UNK Around a Black UNK may come with the opening of nearby Montgomery County suburbs to Negro residents and, presumably, the consequent conclusion of some whites that they cannot escape the Negro by fleeing to the suburbs. In fact, short of fleeing to UNK Virginia, or UNK Maryland, white people may have to live with Negroes. All of this must be taken into account before the image of an UNK D&C& public school system is UNK up. UNK TO UNK From the Summary Report before us at this Conference, a number of problems are apparent. They UNK us and UNK us but generally do not divide us like the issues which follow the problems. First, how can we step up the desegregation movement? It is slow. I believe we all want more schools where white and Negro together can and do attend. I believe we all want no child denied admission to a school on account of his color. In general, members of UNK would certainly want a child admitted to a school nearest his residence or within his residence zone. How to achieve this objective is a problem, but we are not divided on what we want. Second, as we increase the number of desegregated school districts and schools themselves, how can we achieve this action through school board UNK It may be county school board or state school board action, as well as that of municipal school boards. UNK can we reduce the role of the district courts, so that the action is that of the people of the community or other school district and not that of the law UNK This is a problem, and I believe there is little difference of opinion that wherever possible a local school board should devise and effect a plan of desegregation. Third, how can we insure a systematic and continuing group relations education in the UNK Not simply a brief program when the schools are actually desegregated but a continuing program that also promotes integration, that encourages the children and teachers not to look at each other as white or Negro, but as human beings. Again the problem is how to get it done and in what form to offer the group relations education; not whether it should be done. Fourth, in the segregated school system, during the period before UNK how can we assure equal UNK In fact, in the desegregated school system which may have a good many schools with all-Negro population, how can we assure equal UNK This is a problem, but we are not divided over its importance or by its existence. UNK in the segregated school system or in the all-Negro or all-white schools, how can we encourage better group relations or an improved attitude toward people who do not belong to the UNK Can we help children adjust to UNK of other UNK when the latter are not actually present. UNK THE UNK If we have five problems whose solution we seek in relatively united fashion, then there are twice as many issues which, I judge, sharply divide us, UNK relations practitioners and lay people. _ISSUE NO& 1. UNK UNK Since on the one hand school desegregation has come in Virginia UNK with pupil assignment, shall we support the plan? On the basis of pupil assignment criteria, Judge Albert Bryan has assigned Negro children to formerly white schools in Arlington and UNK Virginia. Shall we support pupil UNK On the other hand, looking at the larger picture, is it true that pupil assignment has effectively cut off, UNK or reduced school desegregation to a UNK Shall we therefore oppose the plan? This question is an issue because it likely divides us into two UNK those for or against pupil assignment. _ISSUE NO& 2. UNK UNK IN UNK TO UNK In large cities like Baltimore, UNK and Washington, D&C&, should school desegregation be extended to all-Negro and all-white schools by assigning white and Negro teachers, UNK On the one hand do we argue the Supreme Court decision required only that a UNK not be denied admission to a school on account of his UNK Or should we argue that if we want adjustment of children to children of different races and that that is impossible in an UNK school, we must at least provide him some opportunity to adjust to people of another race within the school namely, to a teacher of another race. We can argue that where residence makes pupil desegregation impossible teacher assignment can create a partially desegregated situation. _ISSUE NO& 3. THE UNK IN UNK UNK UNK The earlier part of my statement deals with the court orders that resulted in desegregation. In each instance the plaintiff was a private UNK In thousands of school districts, indeed, in the entire State of Mississippi, no plaintiff has come forth. And I have established that the action of UNK county, or state school boards or boards of education is small, UNK small in comparison with the number of districts. Is the requirement that the plaintiff be a person actually denied admission to a school a sound UNK Should Congress authorize the Attorney General to file suit to accomplish admission of a child to a school to which he is denied UNK Even though in civil rights legislation in 1957 and 1960 the provision for the Attorney General to act was UNK should we nevertheless support such a UNK This is an issue, for it divides people rather sharply. _ISSUE NO& 4. UNK OF UNK TO UNK THAT UNK UNK ON UNK OF UNK This is the Powell UNK which in 1957 divided even a "liberal" group like the American Veterans Committee UNK Should we support a clause in Federal school construction or school assistance legislation that would deny Federal funds to a school district that denies admission to a child on account of his UNK This is UNK than earlier Powell amendments which would have denied funds to all segregated school districts. There is nonetheless considerable argument against the UNK softened though it be, on the grounds that Federal aid is so necessary to the public schools. The Federal funds limitation UNK the support of many, the opposition of quite a few. _ISSUE NO& 5. UNK UNK UNK Should a political UNK state or county or UNK be required to furnish public education? For the school year, UNK the Prince Edward County UNK Board of UNK voted not to provide funds for public education, and the school board therefore could provide no public UNK for white or Negro children. Is public education in this American democracy of such importance that no child should be denied public education? Or is this subject a matter of self-determination, a matter of states rights or county UNK If people don't want to provide public education, should they be forced to do so? Even if we UNK substantial agreement behind mandatory public education, we likely cannot expect that all the states will enact the legislation. Should the UNK which must therefore be Federal in nature, be UNK by the United States UNK Or must it become law by amendment of the United States UNK We actually have two issues in this question- goal and method. _ISSUE NO& 6. FEDERAL UNK FOR UNK OF THE UNK If the above issue is settled by requiring public education for all citizens, UNK No& 6 may be UNK If, on the other hand, it is not settled, or while it is being debated and UNK does the Federal government have a responsibility in situations like that in Prince Edward UNK Nearly half the children still receive no education. Must or should the Federal government UNK Should the government directly provide education for the children who want public education? The next question is whether board members favor their own social classes in their roles as educational UNK On the whole, it appears that they do not favor their own social classes in an explicit way. UNK is there an issue in which class lines can be clearly drawn. A hypothetical issue of this sort might deal with the establishment of a free public junior college in a community where there already was a good private college which served the middle-class youth adequately but was too expensive for working-class youth. In situations of this sort the board generally favors the expansion of free education. UNK studied the records of UNK school board members in twelve western cities over the period of UNK and found UNK or no relationship between certain social and economic factors and school board UNK as judged by a panel of professional educators who studied the voting records on educational issues. The few cases of clear favoritism along social-class lines are as likely as not to involve representatives of the working class on the school board who favor some such practice as higher wages for janitors rather than pay increases for teachers, and such issues are not issues of educational policy. In general, it appears that trustees and board members attempt to represent the public interest in their administration of educational policy, and this is made easier by the fact that the dominant values of the society are middle-class values, which are generally thought to be valid for the entire society. There have been very few cases of explicit conflict of interest between the middle class and any other class in the field of educational policy. If there were more such cases, it would be easier to answer the question whether the UNK favor their own social classes. There is currently a major controversy of public education in which group interests and values are heavily UNK This is the issue of segregated schools in the South. In this case it is primarily a matter of conflict of racial groups rather than social-class groups. Thus, the white middle and lower classes are UNK against the Negro middle and lower classes. This conflict may be resolved in a way which will suit white middle-class people better than it suits white lower-class people. If this happens, there may be some class conflict in the South, with school boards and school teachers taking the middle-class position. #THE UNK UNK The members of the educational profession have a major voice in the determination of educational policy, their position being strongest in the universities. They are mostly UNK and lower-middle-class people, with a few in the upper class. Do they make UNK UNK In a society dominated by middle-class values and working in an institution which UNK and strengthens these social values, it is clear that the educational profession must work for the values which are characteristic of the society. There is no problem here. The problem UNK if it does arise, when the educator has to make a choice or a decision within the area of his professional UNK but which bears some relation to the social structure. For instance, in giving school grades or in making recommendations for the award of a college UNK does he consciously or unconsciously favor students of one or another social UNK Again, in deciding on the content and method of his teaching, does he favor a curriculum which will make his students stronger competitors in the race for higher economic status, or does he favor a curriculum which strengthens students in other UNK The answers to questions such as these certainly depend to some extent upon the UNK own social-class position and also upon his social history, as well as upon his personality and what he UNK his mission to be as an UNK In a set of case studies of teachers with various social-class UNK UNK illustrates a variety of approaches to students and to teaching which depend upon the UNK personality as well as on his social-class background. One UNK teacher may be a hard UNK for lower-class pupils because she wants them to develop the attitudes and skills that will enable them to UNK while another UNK teacher may be a very permissive person with lower-class pupils because he knows their disadvantages and UNK at home, and he hopes to encourage them by friendly treatment. One social-class factor which plays a large part in educational policy today is the fact that a great many school and college teachers are upward mobile from urban lower-class and lower-middle-class families. Their own experience in the social system influences their work and attitudes as teachers. While this influence is a complex matter, depending upon personality factors in the individual as well as upon his social-class experience, there probably are some general statements about social-class background and educational policy that can be made with a fair degree of truth. Teachers who have been upward mobile probably see education as most valuable for their students if it serves students as it has served them; that is, they are likely to favor a kind of education that has UNK value. This does not necessarily mean that such teachers will favor vocational education, as contrasted with liberal education, but they are likely to favor an approach to liberal education which has a UNK UNK value, as against a kind of "pure" liberal education that is not designed to help people get better jobs. There is no doubt that higher education since World War /2, has moved away from "pure" liberal education toward greater emphasis on technology and UNK There are several causes for this, one being rapid economic development with increasing numbers of middle-class positions requiring engineering or scientific training. But another cause may lie in the experience of so many new postwar faculty members with their own use of education as a means of social UNK UNK with the college and university faculty members of the period from 1900 to 1930, the new postwar faculty members consist of more children of immigrants and more children of urban working-class UNK Their experience is quite in contrast with that of children of upper- and upper-middle-class UNK parents, who are more likely to regard education as good for its own sake and to discount the vocational UNK in the curriculum. #THE UNK UNK UNK Educational policies are formed by several groups who are officially or UNK appointed to act in the public interest. Legislators are one such group, and state legislators have major responsibility for educational legislation. They generally vote so as to serve their own UNK and if the UNK should be solidly middle class or solidly lower class, they might be expected to vote and work for middle- or for lower-class interests in education. However, there are relatively few such political UNK and, as has been pointed out, there is seldom a clear-cut distinction between the educational interests of one social class and those of another. Another public interest group is the commission of laymen or educators which is appointed to study an educational problem and to make recommendations. UNK these commissions work earnestly to represent the interest of the entire society, as they conceive it. Nevertheless, their conclusions and recommendations cannot please UNK and they often represent a particular economic or political point of view. For instance, there have been two Presidential UNK on higher education since World War /2,. President Truman's Commission on Higher Education tended to take a liberal, UNK position, while President Eisenhower's Committee on Education Beyond the High School was slightly more conservative. Both UNK consisted of UNK and UNK people, who attempted to act in the public interest. An example of a more definite class bias is noted in proceedings of the Commission on the UNK of Higher Education sponsored by the Association of American UNK and supported by the Rockefeller Foundation and the Carnegie Corporation. This Commission recommended against the use of federal government funds for the assistance of private universities and against a broad program of UNK UNK This might be said to be an upper- or an upper-middle-class UNK but the Commission published as one of its staff studies a book by Byron S& UNK entitled UNK Should Go to UNK which recommended a federal government scholarship program. Furthermore, the Commission set up the Council for Financial UNK to Education as a means of encouraging private business to increase its support of private higher education. Thus, the Commission acted with a sense of social responsibility within the area of its own convictions about the problem of government support to private education. Then there are the trustees and officers of the great educational UNK who inevitably exert an influence on educational decisions by their support or refusal to support various educational programs, experiments, and UNK These people are practically always upper- or upper-middle-class persons, who attempt to act in what they regard as the interest of the entire society. Finally there are the parent organizations and the UNK organizations such as the National Association of Parents and UNK and the Citizens Committee on Public UNK These have an upper-middle-class leadership and a middle-class membership, with rare exceptions, where working-class parents are active in local UNK matters. Like the other UNK groups, these are middle class in their educational attitudes, and they attempt to act in the general public interest, as they see it. In general it appears that educational decisions and educational policies are made by people who intend to act in the interests of the society as a whole. They are predominantly middle- and UNK people, and undoubtedly share the values and attitudes of those classes. They may be unaware of the existence of lower-class values and consequently fail to take them into account. But there is very little frank and conscious UNK of the interests of any one social class by the people who have the power to make decisions in education. They think of themselves as trustees for the entire society and try to serve the entire society. UNK TO UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK Educational policy in the United States has as an explicit goal the maximization of economic and cultural opportunity. In so far as this goal is achieved, the society becomes more fluid, artificial barriers to social mobility are reduced, and people at the lower end of the social hierarchy share more fully in the material and cultural goods of society. On the other hand, there is a UNK purpose in education which is to pass on the advantages of the parents to their children. This leads to efforts at exclusiveness through private schools and to the maintenance of social UNK in the schools. Both of these purposes exist side by side without much overt conflict under present conditions. UNK UNK AND UNK UNK The broad expansion of free education results both in raising the average economic and cultural level of the society and in promoting UNK within the social structure. Fifty years ago the general raising of the UNK age to sixteen was an example of this movement. During the past decade the program has been carried on through expansion of free higher education in state universities, state colleges, and community colleges. The UNK of American faith in the comprehensive high school, as expressed in the Conant study, is another indication of the UNK of the ideal of maximizing opportunity through the UNK of educational opportunity. The recent federal government's UNK program is another step in the direction of making higher education more available to UNK youth. It is probably more effective than the expanded scholarship programs of the past decade, because the scholarship programs mainly aided the students with the best academic records (who were usually UNK and these students tended to use the scholarship funds to go to more expensive colleges. Meanwhile, the private colleges have increased their UNK rates so much that they have raised an economic barrier which UNK their scholarship funds. The gains in educational opportunity during the past decade have taken place largely in the publicly supported institutions. Unfortunately, however, and for reasons to be discussed in the following chapter, no rate relationships can be made completely UNK as long as all or some of the rates must be set above marginal costs in order to yield adequate revenues. And this fact may explain some of the UNK among the experts as to the more rational formulas for the apportionment of total costs among different units of service. One such UNK which will receive attention in this next chapter, concerns the question whether rates for different kinds of service, in order to avoid the attribute of UNK must be made directly UNK to marginal costs, or whether they should be based instead on UNK in marginal costs. Here, the choice is that between the UNK of a dilemma. #TWO UNK UNK OF UNK UNK UNK UNK _1. THE UNK UNK Despite an ambiguity due to its failure clearly to define UNK costs", the above exposition of fully distributed costing goes about as far as one can go toward expressing the basic philosophy of the practice. For more explicit UNK one must distinguish different types of analyses. By all means the most important distinction is that between those UNK UNK which superimpose a distribution of admittedly unallocable cost UNK on estimates of UNK or marginal costs, and those other UNK which recognize no difference between true cost allocation and mere UNK distribution. The first, or UNK type might also be called the UNK UNK because of its application to railroads (and other transportation UNK by the Cost Section of the Interstate Commerce Commission. The Cost Section distinguishes between UNK variable costs and constant costs in a manner noted in the preceding chapter. The variable costs alone are assigned to the different units of freight traffic as representing UNK out-of-pocket UNK a term with a meaning here not distinctly different from that of the UNK UNK marginal UNK There remains a residue of total costs, or total UNK UNK which, since it is found to behave as if it were constant over substantial variations in traffic density, is strictly unallocable on a UNK basis. Nevertheless, because the Cost Section has felt impelled to make some kind of a distribution of total costs, it has apportioned this UNK which it sometimes calls UNK among the units of UNK traffic on a basis UNK UNK partly UNK which is UNK quite arbitrary from the standpoint of cost UNK In recent years, this burden (which includes allowances for revenue deficiencies in the passenger business and in UNK freight UNK has amounted to about one third of those total revenue requirements which the UNK freight business is supposed to be called upon to meet. Since this book is concerned only incidentally with railroad rates, it will not attempt to analyze the methods by which the staff of the Interstate Commerce Commission has estimated out-of-pocket costs and apportioned residue costs. UNK it to say that the usefulness of the latter apportionment is UNK But in any event, full credit should be given to the Cost Section for its express and overt recognition of a vital distinction too often ignored in UNK UNK namely, that between a cost allocation designed to reflect the actual behavior of costs in response to changes in rates of output of different classes of utility UNK and a mere cost apportionment which somehow spreads among the classes and units of service even those costs that are strictly unallocable from the standpoint of specific cost UNK _2. THE UNK UNK We turn now to a type of fully distributed cost analysis which, unlike the UNK UNK draws no distinction between cost allocation and cost UNK the UNK type. It might be called the "public UNK type because of the considerable use to which it has been put in gas and electric utility rate cases. Here no attempt is made, first to determine out-of-pocket or marginal costs and then to superimpose on these costs UNK UNK UNK of total costs. Instead, all of the total costs are treated as variable costs, although these costs are divided into costs that are deemed to be functions of different variables. Moreover, whereas in Interstate Commerce Commission UNK UNK UNK means a cost deemed to vary in UNK proportion to changes in rate of output, in the type of analysis now under review UNK UNK has been used more UNK so as to cover costs which, while a function of some one variable (such as output of energy, or number of UNK are not necessarily a UNK function. As already noted in an earlier paragraph, the more familiar cost analyses of utility enterprises or utility systems divide the total costs among a number of major classes of service, such as residential, UNK industrial power, street lighting, etc&. This UNK UNK permits many costs to be assigned in their entirety to some one class, such as street lighting, or at least to be excluded completely from some important class or classes. UNK industrial power service, for example, would not be charged with any share of the maintenance costs or capital costs of the UNK distribution lines. But the major portions of the total costs of a utility business are common or joint to all, or nearly all, classes of UNK and these costs must somehow be apportioned among the various classes and then must somehow be UNK among the units of service in order to report unit costs than can serve as tentative measures of reasonable rates. The general basis on which these common costs are assigned to differently measured units of service will be illustrated by the following highly simplified problem of an UNK cost analysis. But before turning to this example, we must distinguish two UNK of analysis, both of which belong to the UNK type rather than to the UNK type. In the first UNK the analyst UNK the practice of railroad analysis in this particular UNK UNK both total operating costs and total annual capital costs (including an allowance for "cost of capital" or "fair rate of UNK among the different classes and units of service. Here, an UNK say, of UNK of the total costs to residential service as a class would include an allowance of perhaps 6 per cent as the cost of whatever capital is deemed to have been devoted to the service of the residential UNK But in the second UNK which I take to be the one more frequently applied, only the operating expenses and not the "cost of capital" or "fair UNK are apportioned directly among the various classes of service. To be sure, the capital investments in (or, alternatively, the estimated "fair UNK UNK the plant and equipment are apportioned among the different classes, as are also the gross revenues received from the sales of the different services. But any resulting excess of revenues received from a given class of service over the operating costs imputed to this class is reported as a UNK realized on the capital investment attributed to the same service. Thus, during any given year (a) if the revenues from the residential service are UNK (b) if the operating expenses imputed to this class of service come to UNK and (c) if the net investment in (or value UNK the plant and equipment deemed devoted to this service amounts to UNK the cost analyst will report that residential service, in the UNK has yielded a return of UNK or UNK per cent. Other services will show different rates of return, some probably much lower and some higher. There are obvious reasons of convenience for this practice of excluding "cost of capital" from the direct apportionment of annual costs among the different classes of service- UNK the avoidance of the controversial question what rate of return should be held to constitute "cost of capital" or "fair rate of UNK But the practice is likely to be UNK since it may seem to support a conclusion that, as long as the revenues from any class of service cover the imputed operating expenses plus UNK return on capital investment, however low, the rates of charge for this service are UNK Needless to say, any such inference would be quite UNK For the reason just suggested, I shall assume the use of the first UNK of fully distributed cost apportionment in the following simplified example. That is to say, an allowance for "cost of capital" will be assumed to be included directly in the cost UNK UNK UNK OF THE COSTS OF AN UNK UNK BUSINESS# In order to simplify the exposition of a typical fully apportioned cost analysis, let us assume the application of the analysis to an electric utility company supplying a single city with power generated by its own UNK plant. Let us also assume the existence of only one class or type of service, all of which is supplied at the same UNK phase, UNK to residential, UNK and industrial customers. This latter assumption will permit us to center attention on the most controversial aspect of modern public utility cost UNK the distinction among costs that are functions of outputs of the same service measured along different dimensions. Since the company under review is supplying what we are here regarding as only one kind of service, we might suppose that the problem of total cost apportionment would be very simple; indeed, that it would be limited to a finding of the total annual operating and capital costs of the business, followed by a calculation of this total in terms of annual cost per kilowatt-hour of consumption. In fact, however, the problem is not so simple. For a statement of costs per kilowatt-hour would ignore the fact that many of these costs are not a function of kilowatt-hour output (or UNK of energy. A recognition of multiple cost functions is therefore required. The simplest division, and the one most frequently used (with UNK in gas and electric rate cases, is a threefold division of the total operating and capital costs into UNK costs", UNK or UNK costs", and UNK or UNK costs. If this threefold division of costs were to have its counterpart in the actual rates of charge for service, as it actually does have in some rates, there would result a three-part rate for any one class of service. For example, the monthly bill of a residential consumer might be the sum of a $1 customer charge, a $5 charge for 250 UNK of energy at UNK per UNK and a $2 charge for a maximum demand of 2 UNK during the month at the rate of $1 per UNK a total bill of UNK for that month. But our present interest lies in the measurement of costs of service, and only indirectly in rates that may or may not be designed to cover these costs. Let us therefore consider each of the three types of cost in turn, recognizing that this simplified classification is used only for illustrative purposes; costs actually vary in much more complex ways. _1. THE CUSTOMER UNK These are those operating and capital costs found to vary with number of customers regardless, or almost regardless, of power consumption. Included as a minimum are the costs of UNK and billing along with whatever other expenses the company must incur in taking on another UNK These minimum costs may come to $1 per month, more or less, for residential and small commercial customers, although they are substantially higher for large industrial UNK who require more costly connections and UNK devices. While costs on this order are sometimes separately charged for in residential and commercial rates, in the form of a mere UNK UNK they are more frequently wholly or partly covered by a minimum charge which entitles the consumer to a very small amount of gas or electricity with no further payment. But the really controversial aspect of UNK UNK arises because of the cost analyst's frequent practice of UNK not just those costs that can be definitely UNK as incurred for the benefit of specific customers but also a substantial fraction of the annual maintenance and capital costs of the secondary UNK distribution system- a fraction equal to the estimated annual costs of a hypothetical system of minimum capacity. The UNK of sociology have remained largely UNK by the UNK Like primitive numbers in mathematics, the entire UNK framework is taken to rest upon its operational worth. But what is the operational worth of a sociology which UNK reproduces the idea of physical UNK Is it not the task of philosophy to see what intelligible meaning can be assigned to the most sacred canons in social UNK It has become painfully clear that the very attempt to make the language of social research free of values by erecting mathematical and physical models, is itself a conditioned response to a world which pays a premium price for technological UNK This push to UNK the study of mass UNK to the measurements of parameters involved in differential equations has led sociology UNK close to the reduction of the word UNK to mean a small group in which certain relations between all pairs of individuals in such a group can be studied. (Cf& UNK UNK UNK UNK Here I think the role of the philosopher becomes apparent. The simple pragmatic success of the sociology of small groups needs to be UNK For if the small group notion involves the implicit claim that the phenomena of sociological investigations are of atomic or UNK UNK the philosopher needs to know the extent to which such entities are UNK The mere exploration of the unconscious ground of present-day sociology offers a rich vein of philosophical and logical investigation. (Cf& UNK UNK Ch& UNK A parallel function for philosophy is the study of the relation between perceptions UNK received and conceptions logically formed. Philosophy can supply adequate criteria of meaning in the selection of socially viable categories. This involves a UNK of the empirical and rational elements entering into each social science statement. UNK functional sociology may have great practical use in the study of different UNK yet it is perfectly clear as UNK UNK and UNK UNK UNK that the concept of function in sociology has been built up from physiological and biological models, in which the notions of UNK i&e&, metaphysical purpose, are UNK (Cf& Chapter UNK UNK as a sociological credo is, therefore, not a direct consequence of observations, but rather an indirect consequence of philosophical inference and judgment. The purpose of this sort of philosophical study of sociology is not to UNK but to clarify the principles of social science. It is absurd to speak of philosophy as a superior enterprise to UNK since the former is a UNK rational discipline, where sociology is essentially descriptive and UNK Such a position entails the UNK of philosophy in its UNK form as something soaring above and embracing the empirical and mathematical sciences. But contrary to UNK philosophy is not a synonym for UNK The uses of philosophy as a logical clearing house are manifest to any approach that does not UNK to pure UNK However, when philosophy attempts to stand above the sciences, to dictate the conditions of empirical research, it becomes formal UNK shaping the contours of life to fit the needs of UNK The notion of philosophy as Queen UNK may fit well with authoritarian modes of political ideology, but it has been noted that the price of such an imperial notion of philosophy is the frustration and UNK of the social sciences. (Cf& UNK UNK UNK /2, Ch& UNK Horowitz UNK UNK is no longer a direct UNK with nature as it was in UNK It has surrendered any claims of description in favor of psychological accounts of UNK as in UNK system UNK Science is UNK for UNK to know nothing of UNK in a last ditch effort to save the gods at the expense of men. It is not positivism which has isolated metaphysics from reality by distinguishing between description and UNK It is simply revealing the state to which metaphysical thinking has fallen during this century. Consider the traditional UNK UNK of UNK logic, ethics, UNK and UNK It is a commonplace that to the degree these special preserves of past philosophic hunting grounds establish an empirical content and suitable methodological criteria, they move away from philosophy as such. What is left to traditional systems of philosophy is, in effect, only the history of these fields prior to their becoming rigorous enough to abide by the canons of scientific method. In this situation, philosophy has survived by separating itself from metaphysics, by showing the ultimate questions to be the meaningless questions. The UNK by philosophy of pretentious claims to empirical priority gives it an ability to treat problems of meaning and truth which in the past it was unable to examine because of its missionary attitude to knowledge of more humble UNK In the new situation, philosophy is able to provide the social sciences with the same guidance that mathematics offers the physical sciences, a reservoir of logical relations that can be used in framing UNK having explanatory and predictive value. Beyond this, philosophy may urge the social sciences forward by asking the type of question that falls outside the present scope of social inquiry, but within its potential domain of UNK In this connection, it might be noted that the theory of games was a mathematical discovery long before its uses in political science were UNK Likewise, UNK formulated the UNK hypothesis, according to which the solar system was evolved from a rotating mass of UNK gas, nearly a half century before its scientific value was made plain by UNK in his UNK du UNK This does not mean that philosophy UNK the problems it UNK any more so than UNK geometry settled the physical status of the UNK UNK But the forceful presentation of new issues for the sciences to work on is itself a monumental task. To those raised on UNK UNK UNK and UNK UNK UNK this may seem a modest role for philosophy. However, UNK and UNK are different qualities. Philosophy conceived of as servant to the sciences might appear as less dramatic than philosophy which UNK as the sciences UNK The UNK effort to understand and measure the distance mankind has traversed since its primitive UNK status offers a more durable sort of drama. By clarifying fundamental premises in the social sciences, and defining the logical problems UNK at the UNK of each new scientific discipline, philosophy can offer the sort of distinction that can accelerate growth in human understanding. Philosophy can prevent the working scientist from becoming UNK and UNK by noting the assumptions and level at which a hypothesis or theory is UNK The dissection of scientific theory, the examination of a theory from the UNK of language, UNK and ethics, is itself a distinct contribution to knowledge, no less so because of its removal from empirical research. The realm of science, whatever the degree of precision in formulations, covers the range of prediction and explanation. (Cf& UNK and UNK UNK Whatever philosophy is conceived to be, its UNK UNK attitude to evidence should make it clear that it is something other than science. For some forms of philosophy, this very division between the empirical and the rational becomes a sign of the metaphysical superiority of the latter. UNK and UNK announce that "the secret is the center of a UNK and thereafter a hundred followers declare secrecy a higher UNK This is simply a confession of intellectual UNK UNK up to look UNK For as UNK indicated (1953), it is not the secret which is important, but the removal of UNK In this, philosophy and science share a common goal. The UNK of the secret nonetheless guarantees that the division of analytical and synthetic UNK shall not be overcome by even the most persuasive UNK for this division is but an abstract representation of the social struggle between UNK and science. The UNK of metaphysical systems does not imply the demise of philosophy, only the close of a philosophic age which demanded metaphysics to be rational and UNK The UNK with which present metaphysical attitudes UNK private intuition offers the strongest evidence that the gulf between scientific and UNK ways of UNK is built into the present conflict over the limits and purpose of science, religion and UNK (Cf& UNK UNK Scientific systems, and this includes even the relation of UNK to UNK physics, are built upon, refined and UNK UNK systems, by the very nature of their UNK are UNK by rival systems. In addition to the UNK of science and the UNK of metaphysics, they differ in that science is essentially UNK while philosophy in its inherited forms, tends to be UNK UNK and UNK The UNK notion that belief, unlike UNK is not subject to objective analysis, has placed intuitive metaphysics squarely against the sociology of knowledge, since it is precisely the job of the sociology of knowledge to treat beliefs as social facts no less viable than social UNK When dealing with the actual relation of philosophy to the sociology of knowledge, or better the role of philosophy in assisting research on the social sources of ideas, one has to become necessarily UNK Certain features we have touched UNK philosophy as a UNK UNK system from which a social science UNK can be built UNK philosophic analysis of the assumptions and UNK of the social UNK and philosophy as a guide to possible integration of supposedly disparate sociological investigations. The objection will be raised that the most important role of philosophy in relation to social science has been omitted, namely the status of ultimate value questions and norms operative in the social sciences. UNK it will be asked whether the UNK questions people ask are not the UNK questions that social science finds itself UNK in the face of. What then is the status of such questions as: is society the ground of human existence or a means to an individual UNK Do societies develop according to cosmic patterns or are they subject only to the free choice of UNK Does society really exist as an entity over and above the agglomeration of UNK I think it must be said that, contrary to metaphysical UNK these are questions so framed as to defy either empirical exploration or rational solutions. As UNK UNK and UNK UNK indicated, questions of whether the value of life is individual or social are not questions, but UNK of faith made to appear as legitimate questions. Such UNK assume that answers of concrete significance can be supplied to statements involving undefined UNK Social theory has no more right to expect results from meaningless questions, than physics has the right to expect a theological solution to the UNK UNK It is not that such questions are not asked. It is rather that introducing them into social analysis reflects not so much a search for truth as for certainty. An operational approach to sociology can never expect abstract UNK since it is certainty which every new discovery in science either replaces or UNK To raise the added objection that men require certainty on psychological grounds, answers to ultimate questions having an irrational rather than scientific basis, is in a real sense to undermine the objection itself. For what concerns all scientific disciplines is precisely that which can be captured for the rational, i&e&, for the scientific determination of what in past ages was considered ultimate and UNK A philosophy which attempts to supply ultimate answers in an ultimate way reveals its acquiescence in the shortcomings of men, an impatience with UNK tentative solutions. Men have always lived in a tentative world, and in suspension of ultimate judgments where and when necessary. UNK overcoming itself is the UNK of the quest for new and more precise information about the world. Without such uncertainty we are left with a set of UNK and UNK The functional interplay of philosophy and science should, as a minimum, guarantee a meaningful option to UNK A degree of UNK is a salutary condition for the growth of science. But neither was the statement UNK for goodness was not a quality like red or UNK that could be seen or heard. What were they to do, then, with these awkward judgments of UNK To find a place for them in their theory of knowledge would require them to revise the theory radically, and yet that theory was what they regarded as their most important discovery. It appeared that the theory could be saved in one way only. If it could be shown that judgments of good and bad were not judgments at all, that they asserted nothing true or false, but merely expressed emotions like UNK or UNK then these wayward judgments would cease from UNK and weary heads could be at rest. This is the course the UNK UNK They explained value judgments by explaining them away. Now I do not think their view will do. But before discussing it, I should like to record one vote of thanks to them for the clarity with which they have stated their case. It has been said of John Stuart UNK that he wrote so clearly that he could be found out. This theory has been put so clearly and precisely that it deserves criticism of the same kind, and this I will do my best to supply. The theory claims to show by analysis that when we say, "That is good", we do not mean to assert a character of the subject of which we are thinking. I shall argue that we do mean to do just that. Let us work through an example, and the simpler and UNK the better. There is perhaps no value statement on which people would more universally agree than the statement that intense pain is bad. Let us take a set of circumstances in which I happen to be interested on the legislative side and in which I think every one of us might naturally make such a statement. We come upon a rabbit that has been caught in one of the brutal traps in common use. There are signs that it has struggled for days to escape and that in a frenzy of hunger, pain, and fear, it has all but eaten off its own leg. The attempt UNK the animal is now dead. As we think of the long and UNK pain it must have suffered, we are very likely to say: "It was a bad thing that the little animal should suffer so". The positivist tells us that when we say this we are only expressing our present emotion. I hold, on the contrary, that we mean to assert something of the pain itself, namely, that it was UNK bad when and as it occurred. Consider what follows from the positivist view. On that view, nothing good or bad happened in the case until I came on the scene and made my remark. For what I express in my remark is something going on in me at the time, and that of course did not exist until I did come on the scene. The pain of the rabbit was not itself UNK nothing evil was happening when that pain was being UNK UNK in the only sense in which it is involved at all, waited for its appearance till I came and looked and felt. Now that this is at odds with our meaning may be shown as follows. Let us put to ourselves the hypothesis that we had not come on the scene and that the rabbit never was discovered. Are we prepared to say that in that case nothing bad occurred in the sense in which we said it UNK Clearly not. Indeed we should say, on the contrary, that the accident of our later discovery made no difference whatever to the badness of the UNK pain, that it would have been every UNK as bad whether a chance UNK happened later to discover the body and feel UNK or not. If so, then it is clear that in saying the suffering was bad we are not expressing our feelings only. We are saying that the pain was bad when and as it occurred and before anyone took an attitude toward it. The first argument is thus an ideal experiment in which we use the method of difference. It removes our present expression and shows that the badness we meant would not be affected by this, whereas on positivist grounds it should be. The second argument applies the method in the reverse way. It ideally removes the past event, and shows that this would render false what we mean to say, whereas on positivist grounds it should not. Let us suppose that the animal did not in fact fall into the trap and did not suffer at all, but that we mistakenly believe it did, and say as before that its suffering was an evil thing. On the positivist theory, everything I sought to express by calling it evil in the first case is still present in the second. In the only sense in which badness is involved at all, whatever was bad in the first case is still present in its UNK since all that is expressed in either case is a state of feeling, and that feeling is still there. And our question is, is such an implication consistent with what we UNK Clearly it is not. If anyone asked us, after we made the remark that the suffering was a bad thing, whether we should think it relevant to what we said to learn that the incident had never occurred and no pain had been suffered at all, we should say that it made all the difference in the world, that what we were asserting to be bad was precisely the suffering we thought had occurred back there, that if this had not occurred, there was nothing left to be bad, and that our assertion was in that case mistaken. The suggestion that in saying something evil had occurred we were after all making no mistake, because we had never meant UNK to say anything about the past suffering, seems to me merely UNK If we did not mean to say this, why should we be so relieved on finding that the suffering had not UNK On the theory before us, such relief would be UNK for in that suffering itself there was nothing bad at all, and hence in its UNK there would be nothing to be relieved about. The positivist theory would here distort our meaning beyond recognition. So far as I can see, there is only one way out for the UNK He holds that goodness and badness lie in feelings of approval or disapproval. And there is a way in which he might hold that badness did in this case precede our own feeling of disapproval without belonging to the pain itself. The pain in itself was UNK but unfortunately the UNK on no grounds at all, took up toward this neutral object an attitude of disapproval and that made it for the first time, and in the only intelligible sense, bad. This way of escape is theoretically possible, but since it has grave difficulties of its own and has not, so far as I know, been urged by UNK it is perhaps best not to spend time over it. I come now to a third argument, which again is very simple. When we come upon the rabbit and make our remark about its suffering being a bad thing, we presumably make it with some UNK the UNK are plainly right in saying that such remarks do usually express feeling. But suppose that a week later we revert to the incident in thought and make our statement again. And suppose that the circumstances have now so changed that the feeling with which we made the remark in the first place has UNK The pathetic evidence is no longer before us; and we are now so UNK in body and mind that feeling is, as we say, quite dead. In these circumstances, since what was expressed by the remark when first made is, on the theory before us, simply UNK the remark now expresses nothing. It is as empty as the word UNK would be when there was no enthusiasm behind it. And this seems to me UNK When we repeat the remark that such suffering was a bad thing, the feeling with which we made it last week may be at or near the UNK point, but if we were asked whether we meant to say what we did before, we should certainly answer UNK We should say that we made our point with feeling the first time and little or no feeling the second time, but that it was the same point we were making. And if we can see that what we meant to say remains the same, while the feeling varies from intensity to near UNK it is not the feeling that we primarily meant to UNK I come now to a fourth consideration. We all believe that toward acts or effects of a certain kind one attitude is fitting and another not; but on the theory before us such a belief would not make sense. UNK and Ross have lately contended that this fitness is one of the main facts of ethics, and I suspect they are right. But that is not exactly my point. My point is this: whether there is such fitness or not, we all assume that there is, and if we do, we express in moral judgments more than the UNK say we do. Let me UNK In his novel <The House of the UNK UNK tells of his experiences in a UNK prison camp. Whatever the unhappy UNK of such camps are like today, UNK companions were about as grim a lot as can be imagined. "I have heard UNK he writes, "of the most UNK the most unnatural actions, of the most monstrous murders, told with the most spontaneous, UNK merry UNK Most of us would say that in this delight at the killing of others or the causing of suffering there is something very UNK If we were asked why we thought so, we should say that these things involve great evil and are wrong, and that to take delight in what is evil or wrong is plainly UNK Now on the UNK view, this answer is ruled out. For before someone takes up an attitude toward death, suffering, or their UNK they have no moral quality at all. There is therefore nothing about them to which an attitude of approval or condemnation could be fitting. They are in themselves UNK and, so far as they get a moral quality, they get it only through being invested with it by the attitude of the UNK But if that is true, why is any attitude more fitting than any UNK Would applause, for example, be fitting if, apart from the applause, there were nothing good to UNK Would condemnation be fitting if, independently of the UNK there were nothing bad to UNK In such a case, any attitude would be as fitting or UNK as any other, which means that the notion of fitness has lost all point. Indeed we are forced to go much farther. If goodness and badness lie in attitudes only and hence are brought into being by them, those men who greeted death and misery with UNK merry laughter are taking the only sensible line. If there is nothing evil in these things, if they get their moral complexion only from our feeling about them, why shouldn't they be greeted with a UNK To greet them with UNK would turn what before was neutral into something UNK it would UNK bring badness into the world; and even on UNK assumptions that does not seem very bright. On the other hand, to greet them with delight would convert what before was neutral into something good; it would bring goodness into the world. The injured German veteran was a former UNK twenty-four years old, who had been wounded by UNK in the back of the head. This resulted in damage to the UNK lobe and very probably to the left side of the UNK also. In any event, the extraordinary result of this injury was that he became UNK UNK while at the same time, apparently, the sense of touch remained essentially UNK UNK blindness is a condition in which there is a total absence of visual UNK a condition in which, for example, one is unable to remember something just seen or to UNK up a UNK of the visible appearance of a well-known friend in his UNK This circumstance in the patient's case plus the fact that his tactual capacity remained basically in sound working order constitutes its exceptional value for the problem at hand since the evidence presented by the authors is overwhelming that, when the patient closed his eyes, he had absolutely no spatial UNK is, UNK awareness UNK The necessary UNK as the authors themselves interpret it, would seem to be this: UNK UNK qualities are not among those grasped by the sense of touch, <as UNK We do not arrive at spatial images by means of the sense of touch <by UNK (2) UNK becomes part of the tactual sensation only by way of visual UNK that is, there is, in the true sense, only a UNK UNK The underlying assumption, of course, is that only sight and touch enable us, in any precise and fully dependable way, to locate objects in space beyond us, the other senses being UNK UNK if not totally inadequate, in this regard. This is an assumption with which few would be disposed to quarrel. Therefore, if the sense of touch is functioning normally and there is a complete absence of spatial awareness in a UNK person when the eyes are closed and an object is UNK the conclusion seems unavoidable that touch by itself cannot focus and take possession of the UNK of things and that actual sight or visual representations are necessary. The force of the UNK analysis (if indeed it has any UNK can be felt by the reader, I believe, only after three questions have been successfully answered. (1) What allows us to think that the patient had no UNK representations when his eyes were UNK (2) What evidence is there that he was UNK UNK (3) How can we be sure that his sense of touch was not profoundly disturbed by his head UNK We shall consider these in the inverse order of their presentation. Obviously, a satisfactory answer to the third question is UNK if the argument is to get under way at all, for if there is any possibility of doubt whether the patient's tactual sensitivity had been impaired by the UNK UNK any findings UNK in regard to the first question become completely ambiguous and fail UNK of course, as evidence to establish the desired conclusion. The answer the authors give to it, therefore, is of supreme importance. It is as follows: "The usual sensitivity tests showed that the specific qualities of UNK UNK pain, UNK as well as the kinesthetic sensations UNK feelings, feelings in the UNK and UNK were, as such, essentially intact, although they seemed, in comparison with normal reactions, to be somewhat diminished over the entire body. The supposed tactual sense of spatial location and orientation in the patient and his ability to specify the location of a member, as well as the direction and scope of a movement, UNK executed (with one of his UNK proved to have been, on the contrary, very considerably affected". The authors insist, however, that these UNK in the sense of touch were due absolutely to no organic disorders in that sense faculty but rather to the injuries which the patient had sustained to the sense of sight. First of all, what is their evidence that the tactual apparatus was fundamentally UNK (1) When an object was placed in the patient's hand, he had no difficulty determining whether it was warm or cold, sharp or UNK rough or smooth, UNK soft, or UNK and he could tell, simply by the feel of it, whether it was made of wood, UNK cloth, UNK and so on. And he could UNK by touch alone, articles which he had handled immediately before, even though they were altogether unfamiliar to him and could not be identified by him; that is, he was unaware what kind of objects they were or what their use was. (2) The patient attained an astonishing efficiency in a new trade. Because of his brain injury and the extreme damage suffered to his UNK the patient had to train himself for a new line of work, that of a UNK an occupation requiring a great deal of precision in the making of measurements and a fairly UNK sense of form and UNK It seems clear, when one takes into consideration the exceedingly defective UNK of the patient (we shall describe it in detail in connection with our second question, the one concerning the psychical blindness of the UNK that he had to rely on his sense of touch much more than the usual UNK and that consequently that faculty was most probably more sensitive to shape and size than that of a person with normal vision. And so the authors UNK "The conduct of the patient in his UNK life and in his work, even more than the foregoing facts UNK above under UNK leave positively no room for doubt that the sense of touch, in the ordinary sense of the word, was UNK or, to put the same thing in physiological terms, that the UNK of the tactual apparatus, from the periphery up to the tactual centers in the UNK that is, from one end to the UNK was UNK If the argument is accepted as essentially sound up to this point, it remains for us to consider whether the patient's difficulties in orienting himself UNK and in locating objects in space with the sense of touch can be explained by his defective visual condition. But before we can do this, we must first find answers to our original questions 1 and 2; then we shall perhaps be in a position to provide something like a complete answer to the question at hand. In what ways, then, did the patient's psychical blindness manifest UNK He could not see objects as UNK UNK and organized figures, as a person does with normal vision. The meaning of this, as we shall see, is that he had no fund of visual UNK of objects as objects; and, therefore, he could not recognize even UNK things upon seeing them again. Instead, he constantly became lost in parts and components of them, confused some of their details with those of neighboring objects, and so on, unless he allowed time to UNK the object in question through minute movements of the head and hands and in this way to discover its UNK According to his own UNK he never actually saw things as shaped but only as generally amorphous UNK of color of a more or less indefinite UNK at their edges they slipped pretty much out of focus altogether. But by the tracing procedure, he could, in a strange obviously kinesthetic manner, find the unseen form; could piece, as it were, the UNK mass together into an organized whole and then recognize it as a man or a UNK or whatever it turned out to be. If, however, the figure to be UNK were UNK composed of several interlocking UNK and so on, even the tracing process failed him, and he could not focus even relatively simple shapes among its parts. This UNK UNK that the patient could not read at all without making UNK movements of the head or body, became easily confused by UNK UNK inserted between UNK words and thus confused the mark for one of the letters, and could recognize a simple straight line or a curved one only by tracing it. The patient himself denied that he had any visual imagery at UNK and there was ample evidence of the following sort to UNK him. After a conversation with another man, he was able to UNK practically everything that had been said but could not describe at all what the other man looked like. Nor could he call up UNK of close friends or UNK In short, both his own UNK and his UNK UNK when he looked at objects, seem to present undeniable evidence that he had simply no visual memory at all. He was UNK of the form of the object actually being UNK precisely because he could not assign it to a visual shape, already learned and held in visual memory, as persons of normal vision do. He could not recognize it; he was absolutely unfamiliar with it because he had no visual memory at all. Therefore, his only recourse was to learn the shape all over again for each new visual experience of the same individual object or type of UNK and this he could do only by going over its mass with the tracing procedure. Then he might finally recognize it, apparently by combining the visual UNK actually being seen, with tactual feelings in the head or body accompanying the tracing movements. This would mean, it can readily be seen, that, again, for each new visual experience the tracing motions would have to be repeated because of the absence of visual UNK As one would UNK the procedure, however, could be repeated with the same object or with the same type of object often enough, so that the corresponding visual blots and the UNK beginning of the tracing movement would provide clues as to the actual shape, which the patient then immediately could determine by a kind of UNK UNK trees, automobiles, houses, and so on- objects continually confronted in everyday life- had each its characteristic UNK and became easily UNK at the very beginning of UNK by an inference as to what each was. UNK for example, he UNK from black dots on a white surface. He evidently could not actually see the corners of these objects, but their size and the dots gave them away. And the authors give numerous instances of calculated guessing on the patient's part to show how large a role it played in his process of UNK himself and how proficient he became at it. Often he seems even to have been able to guess UNK without the tracing UNK solely on the basis of qualitative differences among the UNK things which appeared in his visual experience. Perhaps the very important question- What is, then, exactly the role of kinesthetic sensations in the patient's ability to recognize forms and shapes by means of the tracing movements when he is actually looking at UNK has now been raised in the UNK mind and in the following form. If the patient can perceive figure UNK when he cannot perceive it UNK then, it would seem, the sense of touch has immediate contact with the spatial aspects of things in independence of visual UNK at least in regard to two dimensions, and, as we shall see, even this much spatial awareness on the part of UNK touch is denied by the UNK How, then, do the kinesthetic sensations function in all this? The authors set about answering this fundamental question through a detailed investigation of the patient's ability, UNK (1) to perceive figure and (2) to locate objects in space, with his eyes closed (or turned away from the object UNK Quite naturally, they make the investigation, first, by prohibiting the patient from making any movements at all and then, later, by repeating it and allowing the patient to move in any way he wanted to. When the patient was not allowed to move his body in any way at all, the following striking results occurred. Whenever artists, indeed, turned to actual representations or molded three-dimensional figures, which were rare down to 800 B&C&, they tended to reflect reality (see UNK UNK UNK a UNK abstract treatment of men and animals, <by UNK rose only in the late eighth century. To speak of this underlying view of the world is to embark upon matters of subjective judgment. At the least, however, one may conclude that Geometric potters sensed a logical UNK their principles of composition stand very close to those which appear in the Homeric UNK and the UNK line. Their world, again, was a still simple, traditional age which was only slowly beginning to appreciate the complexity of life. And perhaps an observer of the vases will not go too far in UNK that the outlook of their makers and UNK was basically stable and UNK The storms of the past had died away, and the great UNK which was to mark the following century had not yet begun to disturb men's minds. Throughout the work of the later ninth century a calm, severe serenity displays itself. In the vases this spirit may perhaps at times bore or repel one in its internal UNK but the best of the Geometric pins have rightly been considered among the most beautiful ever made in the Greek world. The ninth century was in its artistic work "the spiritually UNK and most UNK between past and UNK and the loving skill spent by its artists upon their products is a UNK to their sense that what they were doing was important and was UNK _THE UNK IN 800 UNK UNK UNK has not yet received the UNK detailed study which it UNK partly because the task is a mammoth one and partly because some of its local UNK as at UNK are only now coming to light. From even a cursory inspection of its many aspects, however, the historian can deduce several fundamental conclusions about the progress of the Aegean world down to 800 B&C& The general intellectual outlook which had appeared in the eleventh century was now consolidated to a significant degree. Much which was in UNK in 1000 had become reasonably well developed by 800. In this process the UNK UNK had been transmuted or finally UNK the Aegean world which had existed before 1000 differed from that which rises more clearly in our vision after 800. Those modern scholars who urge that we must keep in mind the fundamental continuity of Aegean development from earliest times- granted occasional UNK of peoples and ideas from UNK are UNK but all too many observers have been misled by this fact into minimizing the degree of change which took place in the early first UNK The focus of novelty in this world now lay in the UNK districts of the Greek UNK and by 800 virtually the entire UNK always UNK its northern UNK had accepted the Geometric style of pottery. While Protogeometric vases usually turn up, especially outside Greece proper, together with as many or more examples of local UNK these UNK patterns had mostly vanished by the later ninth century. In their place came local variations UNK the common style- UNK as it were, in Protogeometric products but truly distinct and sharply defined as the Geometric spirit developed. UNK though important, was not the only teacher of this age. One can take a vase of about 800 B&C& and, without any knowledge of its place of origin, venture to assign it to a specific UNK imitation and borrowing of motifs now become UNK The potters of the Aegean islands thus stood apart from those of the UNK and in Greece itself UNK UNK UNK UNK and other Geometric sequences have each their own UNK These local variations were to become ever UNK in the next century and a half. The same conclusions can be drawn from the other physical evidence of the Dark ages, from linguistic distribution, and from the UNK of early social, political, and religious patterns into later ages. By 800 B&C& the Aegean was an area of common tongue and of common culture. On these pillars rested that solid basis for life and thought which was soon to be manifested in the remarkably unlimited UNK of the UNK Everywhere within the common pattern, however, one finds local UNK Greek history and culture were UNK UNK and UNK by the interplay of these conjoined yet opposed factors. Further we cannot go, for the Dark ages deserve their name. Many aspects of civilization were not yet sufficiently UNK to find expression, nor could the simple economic and social foundations of this world support a lofty structure. The epic poems, the consolidation of the Greek UNK the rise of firm political units, the UNK which could permit painted and sculptured representations of men- all these had to await the progress of following decades. What we have seen in this chapter, we have seen only UNK and yet the results, however general, are worth the UNK These are the centuries in which the inhabitants of the Aegean world settled firmly into their minds and into their institutions the foundations of the Hellenic outlook, independent of outside forces. To UNK indeed, the era from 1000 to 800 as a period mainly of consolidation may be a necessary but unfortunate defect born of our lack of detailed UNK if we could see more UNK we probably would find many side issues and wrong UNK which came to an end within the period. The historian can only point out those lines which were major enough to find reflection in our limited evidence, and must hope that future UNK will enrich our understanding. Throughout the Dark ages, it is clear, the Greek world had been developing slowly but UNK The pace could now be UNK for the inhabitants of the Aegean stood on firm ground. #CHAPTER 5 THE UNK UNK UNK THE UNK of Greek history UNK UNK and rather UNK in the eighth century B&C&, the age of UNK UNK UNK The first slanting rays of the new day cannot yet UNK all the dark shadows which lie across the Aegean world; but our evidence grows considerably in variety and shows more unmistakably some of the lines of change. For this period, as for earlier centuries, pottery remains the most secure UNK the ceramic material of the age is more UNK more UNK and more indicative of the hopes and fears of its makers, who begin to show scenes of human life and death. UNK and simple UNK UNK the emergence of sculpture and architecture in Greece; objects in gold, UNK and bronze grow more UNK Since writing was practiced in the Aegean before the end of the century, we may hope that the details of tradition will now be occasionally UNK Though it is not easy to apply the evidence of the <Iliad> to any specific era, this marvelous product of the epic tradition had certainly taken definitive shape by UNK The UNK Geometric pottery of Athens and the <Iliad> are amazing manifestations of the inherent potentialities of Greek UNK but both were among the last products of a phase which was UNK Greek civilization was swirling toward its great revolution, in which the developed qualities of the Hellenic outlook were suddenly to break forth. The revolution was well under way before 700 B&C&, and UNK signs go back virtually across the century. The era, however, is UNK While many UNK point forward, the main achievements stand as a culmination of the simple patterns of the Dark ages. The dominant pottery of the century was UNK political organization UNK about the UNK trade was just beginning to UNK the gods who protected the Greek countryside were only now putting on their sharply UNK dress. The modern student, who knows what was to come next, is likely to place first the factors of change which are visible in the eighth century. Not all men of the period would have accepted this UNK Many potters clung to the past the more UNK as they were confronted with radically new UNK the poet of the <Iliad> deliberately UNK Although it is not possible to UNK old and new in this era, I shall consider in the present chapter primarily the first decades of the eighth century and shall interpret them as an UNK of the first stage of Greek civilization. On this principle of division I must postpone the evolution of UNK architecture, society, and UNK for the developments in these areas make sense only if they are connected to the age of revolution itself. The growing contacts between Aegean and UNK are also a phase which should be linked primarily to the remarkable broadening of Hellenic culture after UNK We shall not be able entirely to pass over these connections to the East as we consider Ripe Geometric UNK the epic and the myth, and the religious evolution of early Greece; the important point, however, is that these magnificent UNK unlike those of later decades, were only incidentally influenced by Oriental models. The UNK of UNK vases and of the <Iliad> lie in the Aegean past. UNK UNK THE UNK of the first half of the eighth century is commonly called Ripe UNK The severe yet harmonious vases of the previous fifty years, the Strong Geometric style of the late ninth century, display as firm a mastery of the principles underlying Geometric UNK but artists now were ready to refine and elaborate their UNK The vases which resulted had different shapes, far more complex UNK and a larger sense of style. Beyond the aesthetic and technical aspects of this expansion we must consider the change in pottery style on broader lines. In earlier centuries men had had enough to do in rebuilding a fundamental sense of order after chaos. They had had to work on very simple foundations and had not dared to give UNK to UNK The UNK in particular, had virtually UNK freehand drawing, elaborate UNK and the curving lines of nature, while yet expressing a belief that there was order in the universe. In their vases were embodied the basic aesthetic and logical characteristics of Greek civilization, at first UNK in Protogeometric work, and then more UNK in the initial stages of the Geometric style. By 800 social and cultural security had been achieved, at least on a simple plane; it was time to take bigger steps, to venture on experiments. Ripe Geometric potters continued to employ the old syntax of UNK and shapes and made use of the well-defined though limited range of motifs which they had UNK In these respects the vases of the early eighth century represent a culmination of earlier lines of progress. To the ancestral UNK however, new materials were added. UNK left less and less of a vase in a plain dark UNK instead they divided the surface into many bands or covered it by UNK patterns into which freehand drawing began to UNK UNK lines, UNK UNK UNK of indefinitely floral nature, birds either singly or in UNK UNK animals in solemn frieze bands (see UNK UNK all these turned up in the more developed fabrics as preliminary signs that the potters were broadening their UNK The rows of animals and birds, in particular, suggest awareness of Oriental animal UNK transmitted perhaps via UNK silver UNK and textiles, but the specific forms of these rows on local vases and metal products are nonetheless Greek. Though the spread of this type of decoration in the Aegean has not yet been precisely UNK it seems to appear first in the UNK which were among the leading UNK of pottery throughout the century. As the material at the command of the potters grew and the volume of their production increased, the local variations within a common style became more evident. UNK 12 illustrates four examples, which are Ripe or Late Geometric work of common spirit but of different schools. Cook had discovered a beef in his possession a few days earlier and, when he could not show the UNK arrested him. Thinking the evidence insufficient to get a conviction, he later released him. Even while suffering the trip to his home, Cook swore to Moore and Lane that he would kill the UNK Three weeks later following his recovery, armed with a writ issued by the UNK justice on UNK prepared by the district attorney, Cook and Russell rode to arrest Martinez. Arriving at UNK they found UNK in his corral and demanded that he UNK Instead, he whirled and ran to his house for a gun forcing them to kill him, Cook reported. Both UNK and Russell's lives were threatened by the Mexicans following the UNK but the company officers felt that in the end, it would serve to quiet them despite their immediate emotion. General manager Pels even suggested that it might be wise to keep the Mexicans in UNK rather than accept their offers to sell out and move away, and try to have a few punished. On February 17, Russell and Cook were sent to the UNK UNK community on the Vermejo to see about renting out UNK the company had UNK While talking with Julian M& UNK Francisco UNK and Juan Marcus appeared, both heavily armed, and after watching the house for a while, rode away. It was nearly UNK before they finished the business with UNK and began riding down the stream. They had traveled only a short distance when they spotted five Mexicans riding along a UNK across the stream just ahead of them. UNK an UNK the two deputies decided to ride up a side UNK taking a short cut into UNK After spending two nights UNK and UNK in UNK the deputies again headed for the Vermejo to finish their business. They stayed with a rancher Friday night and by eleven o'clock Saturday morning passed the old UNK Lee ranch. Half a mile below at the mouth of Salyer's Canyon was an old ranch that the company had purchased from A& J& UNK occupied by a UNK his wife, and an old UNK There were three houses in Salyer's Canyon just at the foot of a low bluff, the road winding along the top, entering above, and then passing down in front of the houses, thence to the UNK To the west of this road was another low bluff, forty or fifty feet high, covered with scrub oak and other brush. As they were riding along this winding road on the bench of land between the two UNK a UNK of rifle fire suddenly crashed around the two officers. Not a bullet touched Cook who was nearer the UNK but one hit Russell in the leg and another broke his arm, passing on through his body. With the first reports, Russell's horse wheeled to the right and ran towards the buildings while UNK followed by a UNK of bullets, raced towards the arroyo of Salyer's Canyon immediately in front of him, just reaching it as his horse fell. UNK his Winchester from its UNK Cook prepared to fight from behind the arroyo bank. UNK were so thick, throwing sand in his face, that he found it difficult to return the fire. UNK Russell's horse in front of the long log building, he assumed his friend had slipped inside and would be able to put up a good fight, so he began working his way down the ditch to join him. At a very shallow place, two Mexicans rushed into the open for a shot. UNK to one UNK Cook UNK one, and the other struggled off with his UNK sending no further fire in his direction. Just before leaving the arroyo where he was partially UNK he did hear shots down at the house. Russell had reached the house as Cook UNK dismounted, but just as the old UNK opened the door to receive him, he fell into the UNK arms- dead. A bullet fired by one of the Mexicans UNK in a little chicken house had passed through his head, tearing a hole UNK square on the outgoing side. Finding him dead, Cook caught Russell's horse and rode to the cattle UNK house to report the incident and request UNK to trail the UNK Before daylight Sunday morning, a posse of twenty-three men under the leadership of Deputy Sheriff Frank MacPherson of UNK followed the trail to the house of Francisco UNK where 100 to 150 Mexicans had UNK MacPherson boldly approached the fortified UNK house and demanded entrance. The men inside informed him that they had some wounded men among them but he would not be allowed to see them even though he offered medical aid. The officer demanded the names of the injured men; the Mexicans not only refused to give them, but told the UNK if they wanted a fight they could have it. Since the strength of the Mexicans had been UNK too small a posse had been UNK and since the deputy had not been provided with search warrants, MacPherson and his men decided it was much wiser to UNK The UNK retreat encouraged the Mexicans to be UNK and UNK During the following week, six tons of hay belonging to one rancher were UNK some buildings, farm tools, two horses, UNK and hay owned by UNK UNK a friendly interpreter for the company, and UNK UNK hay were stolen or UNK and a store was broken into and UNK District Attorney M& W& Mills warned that he would vigorously UNK persons caught committing these crimes or carrying arms- he just didn't catch anyone. UNK threats on his life finally convinced Cook that he should leave New Mexico. His friends advised that it would be only a question of time until either the Mexicans killed him by UNK or he would be compelled to kill them in UNK perpetuating the troubles. By early summer, he wrote from UNK that he was suffering from the wound inflicted in the ambush and was in a bad way UNK so Pels sent him a draft for UNK warning that it was still not wise for him to return. Pels also sent a check for $100 to Russell's widow and had a white marble monument erected on his UNK Cattle stealing and UNK again serious during the spring of UNK placed the land grant company officers in a UNK position. They were reluctant to appoint UNK to protect the property, thus running the risk of creating disturbances such as that on the UNK and yet the cowboys protested that they got no salary for arresting cattle thieves and running the risk of being shot. And the law virtually ignored the situation. The judge became ill just as the UNK District Court UNK no substitute was brought in, no criminal cases heard, only 5 out of UNK cases UNK were tried, and court UNK UNK die after sitting a few days instead of the usual three weeks. Pels UNK UNK and witnesses were put to the expense and UNK of going long distances to UNK business; public money UNK justice UNK nothing UNK and the whole distribution of justice in this county seems to be an absolute UNK Word reached the company that the man behind these UNK was UNK UNK a man with many followers, including a number who were kept in line through fear of him. Although wanted by the sheriff for killing an old man named UNK Jones, the warrant for his arrest had never been served. On May 19, a deputy UNK posse of eight men left Maxwell City and rode thirty-five miles up the Vermejo where they were joined by Juan UNK Martinez. By UNK A&M& they reached his house and found it UNK When they were refused entrance to his brother's house nearby, they smashed down the door, broke the window, and threw lighted clothes wet with kerosene into the room. Still there was no Gonzales and the family would say nothing. About 300 yards up the UNK was a cluster of Mexican houses containing six rooms in the form of a square. While UNK around these buildings, two of the posse recognized the voice of Gonzales speaking to the people inside. He was promised that no harm would UNK him if he would come out, but he cursed and replied that he would shoot any man coming near the door. The posse then asked that he send out the women and children as the building would be fired or torn down over his head if necessary to take him dead or alive. Again he UNK In deadly UNK the UNK methodically stripped away portions of the roof and tossed lighted rags inside, only to have most stamped out by the women as soon as they hit the floor. When it became obvious that he could stay inside no longer, taking a thousand to one chance Gonzales rushed outside, square against the muzzle of a UNK UNK near the heart, he turned to one side and plunged for a door to another room several feet away, three bullets following him. As he pushed open the door he fell on his face, one of his comrades pulling him inside. Not realizing the seriousness of the UNK the UNK warned that if he did not surrender the house would be burned down around him. UNK no answer, they set the fire. When the house was about half UNK his UNK ran to the door and threw up his hands, declaring repeatedly that he did not know the UNK of UNK Finding it true that he was not inside, the deputies returned to the first house and tore holes through the side and the roof until they could see a body on the bed covered by a UNK Several UNK fired into the bed UNK aside the blanket to reveal an apparently UNK hand. UNK six or eight times the body was draped with Russell's pistol, belt, and UNK There was no extra horse so it was left to his comrades who, though numbering in the UNK had stood around on the UNK nearby without firing a shot during the entire attack. Early the next morning, a Mexican telephoned Pels that UNK UNK one of the posse members, was surrounded by ten Mexicans at his father's home on the upper UNK The sheriff and District Attorney Mills hastily swore out a number of UNK against men who had been riding about armed, according to signed statements by UNK and Dr& I& P& UNK and ordered Deputy UNK Clark of UNK to rescue the UNK UNK all night, Clark and twelve men arrived at about seven o'clock May 22. Occasionally they heard UNK signals and a number of UNK were sighted on the hills, disappearing at the UNK approach. A Mexican justice of the peace had issue a writ against UNK for taking part in the UNK of UNK Gonzales so he and his father were anxious to be taken out of danger. The men helped them gather their UNK and escorted them to UNK along with three other families desiring to leave. The ten or more dangerous parties singled out for prosecution were still at large, and Pels realized that if these men entrenched themselves in their UNK houses, defending themselves through UNK it would be most difficult to capture them. Thus he wired J& P& Lower and Sons of UNK "Have you any UNK hand grenades for throwing in a house or across a well loaded with balls or UNK UNK If not, how long to order and what is the UNK He wisely decided that it would be foolish to create a disturbance during the coming UNK particularly since the Mexicans were on their guard. His problem then became one of restraining the American fighters who wanted to clean out the Vermejo by force immediately. The plant was located west of the UNK and south of the location of the former electric light plant. The Manchester Depot UNK Company issued UNK shares of stock at $10 each for construction of a sewer in that UNK and assessments were made for its maintenance. It has given considerable trouble at times and empties right into the UNK Fire District No& 1 discussed its possible purchase in 1945, but considered it an unwise investment. The sewer on UNK Street was constructed when there were only a few houses on the street. as new homes were built they were connected so that all UNK south of School Street are served by it. B& J& UNK is the present treasurer and manager. The 1946 town meeting voted to have the UNK appoint a committee to investigate and report on the feasibility of some system of sewage disposal and a disposal plant to serve Manchester Center, UNK and UNK UNK The committee submitted a report signed by Louis Martin and Leon Wiley with a map published in the 1946 town report. The layout of the sewer lines was designed by Henry W& Taylor, who was the engineer for the Manchester Village disposal plant. No figures were submitted with the report and no action was taken on it by the town. The 1958 town meeting directed town authorities to seek federal and state funds with which to conduct a preliminary survey of a proposed sewage plant with its attendant facilities. The final step was a vote for a UNK bond issue for the construction of a sewage system by the 1959 town meeting, later confirmed by a two-thirds vote at a special town meeting June 21, 1960. There the matter stands with the prospect that soon Manchester may be removed from the UNK of towns contributing raw sewage to its main UNK #@ UNK AND UNK UNK unusual interest in UNK has often been attributed to the fact that the Rev& J& D& UNK headmaster of Burr and UNK UNK was a personal friend and correspondent of the inventor, Samuel F& B& UNK At any rate, Manchester did not lag far behind the first commercial system which was set up in 1844 between Baltimore and Washington.

The <Manchester Journal> commented UNK on the surprising amount of local telegraphic business. In the fall of UNK the UNK Telegraph UNK was established between Manchester and Factory Point by the owners, Paul W& Orvis, Henry UNK J& N& UNK and Clark J& Wait. The line soon lived up to its name, as local messages of moderate length could be sent for a UNK and the company was quickly able to declare very liberal dividends on its capital stock. In UNK the same Clark UNK with H& H& UNK of South UNK formed the "American Telegraph UNK extending from Manchester Depot via Factory Point and South Dorset to Dorset.

This boosted local telegraph business and Manchester UNK in all the free UNK In 1914 when the town was chosen for the U& S& Amateur Golf UNK a representative hurried here from the Boston UNK office.

During that tournament alone, some 250,000 words winged their way out of UNK The old Morse system was replaced locally by the UNK modern automatic method in 1929, when UNK UNK UNK was manager of the Western Union office. During summers, business was so brisk that Mrs& UNK had two assistants and a messenger.

The first known telephone line in Manchester was established in July 1883 between Burr and UNK store at Manchester Depot and the Kent and UNK UNK Company in South Dorset. This was extended the following year to include the railroad station UNK office and UNK Hotel at Factory Point. In November UNK a line connecting several dwelling houses in Dorset was extended to Manchester UNK Telephone wires from Louis UNK house in East Manchester to the UNK lumber job near UNK UNK were up about UNK UNK L& Taylor of Manchester Depot recorded the setting of phone poles in East Dorset and Barnumville in his UNK for UNK These must have been for local calls UNK as in May 1900 the "only long distance UNK in town was transferred from C& B& UNK to Young's shoe store. A small single UNK was installed in the Village over UNK hardware store (later E& H& UNK George UNK was manager and UNK Elizabeth Way was the first UNK and a night operator was also employed.

Service running through Barnumville and to Bennington County towns east of the mountains was in the hands of the UNK Telephone Company" in 1925, but major supervision of telephone lines in Manchester was with the New England Telephone and Telegraph Company, which eventually gained all control. More aerial and underground equipment was installed as well as office improvements to take care of the expanding business. In 1931 Mrs& F& H& UNK agent and chief operator, who was to retire in 1946 with thirty years' service, led agency offices in sales for the year with UNK William UNK who retired in 1938, was a veteran of UNK years' local service. Another veteran telephone operator was Edith UNK UNK who had been in the office forty years at the time of her death in 1960. In UNK Dorset received its own exchange, which made business easier for the Manchester office, but it was not until February 1953 that area service was extended to include Manchester and Dorset. This eliminated toll calls between the two towns. Within a month, calls were up seventy per cent. #@ UNK UNK UNK plays such an important part in community life today that it is difficult to envision a time when current was not available for daily use. Yet one has to go back only some sixty years. The first mention of an electric plant in Manchester seems to be one installed in UNK UNK and UNK UNK on the West Branch in Factory Point. No records are available as to the date or extent of installation, but it may have been in UNK On June 14, 1900 the <Manchester Journal> reported that an electrical engineer was installing an electric light plant for Edward S& UNK at UNK UNK This was working by the end of August and giving satisfactory service. In November 1900 surveying was done under John Marsden on the east mountains to ascertain if it would be possible to get sufficient water and fall to operate an electric power plant. Nothing came of it, perhaps due to lack of opportunity for water storage. The next step was construction by the Manchester Light and Power Company of a plant on the west bank of the UNK south of Union Street bridge. This was nearly completed May 23, UNK with a promise of lights by June 10, but the first light did not go on until September 28. It was at the end of the sidewalk in front of the UNK UNK UNK The first directors of the Manchester Light and Power Company were John UNK M& L& UNK William F& Orvis, George Smith, and John UNK The officers were John UNK president; John C& UNK UNK George Smith, UNK and William F& Orvis, UNK Marsden was manager of the company for ten years and manager of its successor company, the Colonial Light and Power Company, for one year. At about the time the Marsden enterprise was getting under way, the Vail Light and Lumber Company started construction of a chair stock factory on the site of the present Bennington UNK UNK UNK to use its surplus power for generating electricity. Manchester then had two competing power companies until UNK when the Manchester Light and Power Company purchased the transmission system of the Vail Company. This was UNK as the Vail plant burned in UNK The Colonial Light and Power Company was succeeded by the Vermont UNK Corporation, which in turn was absorbed by the Central Vermont Public Service Corporation. The latter now furnishes the area with electricity distributed from a modern UNK at Manchester Depot which was put into operation February 19, 1930 and was improved in January 1942 by the installation of larger UNK For a time following the abandonment of the local plant, electric current for Manchester was brought in from the south with an emergency UNK with the Vermont UNK Company system to the north. Some who have written on <Utopia> have treated it as "a learned diversion of a learned world", "a UNK with which More amused UNK "a holiday work, a spontaneous UNK of intellectual high spirits, a revel of debate, UNK comedy and UNK With respect to this view, two points are worth making. First, it appears to be based on the fact that on its title page <Utopia> is described as UNK UNK It overlooks the other fact that it is described as UNK minus UNK UNK UNK "no less salutary than UNK It also overlooks the fact that in a rational UNK and quite clearly in More's UNK the opposite of serious is not gay but UNK and the opposite of gay is not serious but UNK More believed that a man could be both serious and UNK That a writer who is gay cannot be serious is a common professional illusion, UNK fostered by all too many UNK who mistakenly believe that their UNK efforts should be taken seriously because they are expressed with that dreary UNK which is the only mode of expression their authors are capable of. Secondly, to find a learned diversion and a pleasing joke in More's account of the stupid UNK of early sixteenth century wars, of the anguish of the poor and UNK of the UNK and cruelty of the rich and powerful requires a UNK toward suffering and sin that would be surprising in a moral UNK and most surprising in More himself. Indeed, it is even surprising in the UNK of Christ Church and UNK Professor of UNK History, who UNK this most peculiar view, and in the brilliant Professor of UNK and Renaissance English at Cambridge, who inherited it and is now its most eminent UNK But to return to the main line of our inquiry. It is doubtful that <Utopia> is still widely read because More was medieval or even because he was a UNK indeed, it is likely that these days many who read <Utopia> with interest do not even know that its author was a UNK <Utopia> is still widely read because in a sense More stood on the margin of UNK And if he did stand on the margins of UNK it was not in dying a martyr for such unity as UNK supremacy might be able to force on Western Christendom. It was not even in writing Latin UNK sometimes bawdy ones, or in UNK Lucian from Greek into Latin or in defending the study of Greek against the attack of conservative UNK or in attacking the conservative theologians who opposed UNK UNK study of the New Testament. Similar literary exercises were the common doings of a Christian humanist of the first two decades of the sixteenth century. Had More's writings been wholly limited to such UNK they would be almost as dimly remembered as those of a dozen or so other authors living in his time, whose works UNK survive in the minds of the few hundred scholars who each decade in pursuit of their very specialized occasions read those works. More stands on the margins of modernity for one reason alone- because he wrote <Utopia>. And the evidence that he does, indeed, stand there derives quite simply from the vigorous interest with which rather casual readers have responded to that book for the past century or so. Only one other contemporary of More's evokes so immediate and direct a response, and only one other contemporary work- UNK UNK and <The UNK Can we discover what it is in <Utopia> that has evoked this UNK Remember that in seeking the modern in <Utopia> we do not deny the existence of the medieval and the Renaissance there; we do not even need to commit ourselves to assessing on the same UNK scale the relative importance of the UNK the UNK and the UNK The medieval was the most important to UNK because he sought to place Thomas More, the author of UNK in some intelligible relation with St& Thomas More, the UNK To others whose concern it is to penetrate the significance of Christian UNK the Renaissance elements are of primary concern. But here we have a distinctly modern UNK we want to know why that book has kept on selling the way it UNK we want to know what is UNK new about <Utopia>. What is new about it? To that question the answer is simple; it can be made in two words, Utopian communism. But it is an answer which opens the door wide to an onrush of objections and UNK Surely there is nothing new about communism. We find it in Plato's UNK and in <Utopia> More UNK his debt to that book. We find it in that UNK way of life **h pleasing to Christ and **h still in use among the UNK societies of UNK that is, the better UNK which made it easier to convert the UNK to Christianity. We find it in the later UNK conception of man's natural condition which included the community of all UNK This conception was taken up by the early Church Fathers and by canon lawyers and theologians in the Middle UNK and More was far too well read not to have come across it in one or several of the forms thus given it. But although the idea of communism is very old even in More's day and did not spring UNK from his imagination in UNK it is not communism as such that we are concerned with. We are concerned not with the UNK communism nor with other species of the UNK UNK UNK early Christian, UNK UNK or theological UNK we are concerned with Utopian UNK that is, simply communism as it appears in the imaginary UNK of UNK as More conceived it. Perhaps one way to UNK our sense of the modernity of Utopian communism is to contrast it with the principal earlier types of UNK theory. We will achieve a more vivid sense of what it is by realizing what it is not. In Plato's <Republic> communism is- to speak UNK a communism of UNK Its function is to separate from the base ruled mass, among whom private ownership prevails, the governing UNK UNK Moreover, it is too readily forgotten that in the <Republic> what gave the initial impetus to Plato's UNK into the construction of an imaginary UNK with its UNK communism of goods, UNK and children, was his quest for a canon for the proper ordering of the individual human UNK and it is to this problem that the <Republic> ultimately returns. In More's <Utopia> communism is not a means of separating out a UNK elite from the UNK mass. Utopian communism applies to all UNK And in the economy of the book it is not peripheral but UNK The concern of <Utopia> is with the UNK UNK UNK the best ordering of a civil society; and it is again and again made clear that Utopian communism provides the institutional array UNK to that best UNK To derive Utopian communism from the Jerusalem Christian community of the apostolic age or from its medieval UNK the monastic communities, is with an appropriate shift of UNK misleading in the same way as to derive it from Plato's UNK in the <Republic> we have to do with an elite of physical and intellectual athletes, in the apostolic and monastic communities with an elite of spiritual and religious UNK The apostolic community was literally an UNK chosen by Christ himself. And the monastic communities were supposed to be made up of volunteers selected only after a UNK which would test their religious aptitude for monastic UNK their spiritual UNK Finally, the conception of the UNK community of all possessions which originated with the UNK was firmly fixed in a tradition by More's time, although it was not accepted by all the UNK of the Middle Ages. In that tradition communism lay a safe distance back in the age of innocence before the Fall of UNK It did not serve to contrast the existing order of society with a possible alternative order, because the age of innocence was not a possible alternative once man had UNK The actual function of UNK communism was adequately set forth by St& Gregory almost a UNK before More wrote <Utopia>. "The soil is common to all men **h. When we give the necessities of life to the poor, we restore to them what is already theirs. We should think of it more as an act of justice than UNK Because community not UNK of property is the law of nature no man can assert an absolutely UNK right to what is his. Indeed, of all that is his every man is by nature and reason and therefore by conscience obligated to regard himself as a UNK He is a trustee for the common good, however feeble the UNK which the positive or municipal law of property provides against his misuse of that share of the common UNK wisely or UNK UNK to his UNK In contrast to this UNK view, <Utopia> implies that the nature of man is such that to rely on individual conscience to supply the deficiencies of municipal law is to embark on the UNK sea of human UNK in a UNK The UNK brace conscience with legal UNK In a properly ordered society the massive force of public law performs the function which in natural law theory UNK is left altogether to a small voice so often still. In all the respects just indicated Utopian communism differs from previous conceptions in which community of possessions and living plays a role. Neither from one of these conceptions nor from a combination of them can it be UNK We do not deny originality to the UNK because Aeschylus found the tales of the house of UNK among the folk lore of the UNK In a like sense whatever bits or UNK of previous conceptions one may find in it, Utopian communism remains, as an integral whole, UNK a new thing. It is not merely a new UNK it is one of the very few new things in UNK most of the rest is medieval or humanist or part of an old tradition of social criticism. But to say that at a moment in history something is UNK is not necessarily to say that it is UNK and for this statement the best evidence comes within the five years following the publication of UNK when Martin Luther UNK a new perception of the nature of the UNK encounter with man. UNK indeed, is UNK perception, but not modern, as anyone knows who has ever tried to make intelligible to modern students what Luther was getting at. Although Utopian communism is both new in UNK and also modern, it is not modern communism or even modern socialism, as they exist or have ever existed in theory or in practice. Consider the features of Utopian UNK generous public provision for the UNK democratic and secret elections of all officers including priests, meals taken publicly in common UNK a common habit or uniform prescribed for all UNK even houses changed once a UNK six hours of manual labor a day for all but a handful of magistrates and scholars, and careful measures to prevent anyone from UNK no private property, no UNK no sort of pricing at all for any goods or services, and therefore no market in the economic sense of the term. Whatever the merits of its UNK Utopian communism is far too UNK far too UNK to suit any modern socialist or UNK It is not the details of Utopian communism that make <Utopia> modern, it is the spirit, the attitude of mind that informs those details. What that spirit and attitude were we can best understand if we see more precisely how it contrasts with the communist tradition with the UNK continuous history, the one which reached Christianity by the way of Stoicism through the Church Fathers of Late UNK During the UNK trial the Democratic press condemned the proceedings and UNK UNK as a martyr to the principles of the Declaration of UNK During the Brown trial, however, the state's most powerful Democratic newspaper, the Providence <Daily Post>, stated that Brown was a UNK a man of blood, and that he and his associates, with the assistance of Republicans and UNK had plotted not only the UNK of the slaves but also the overthrow of state and federal governments. The Providence <Daily Journal> answered the <Daily Post> by stating that the raid of John Brown was characteristic of Democratic acts of violence and that "He was acting in direct opposition to the Republican UNK who proclaim as one of their cardinal principles that they do not interfere with slavery in the UNK The two major newspapers in Providence continued, throughout the crisis, to accuse each other of UNK the facts and attempting to UNK history. While the <Daily Post> continued to accuse Republicans and the <Daily Journal> continued to accuse Democrats, the Woonsocket <Patriot> complained that the Virginia authorities showed indecent and cowardly haste to condemn Brown and his men. UNK Foss stated, "Of their guilt **h there can be no doubt **h but they are entitled to sufficient time to prepare for trial, and **h a fair UNK The Providence <Daily Post> thought that there were probably good reasons for the haste in which the trial was being conducted and that the only thing gained by a delay would be UNK feelings. The Providence <Daily Journal> stated that although the guilt of Brown was evident, the South must guarantee him a fair trial to preserve domestic peace. On October 31, 1859, John Brown was found guilty of treason against the state of Virginia, UNK slave UNK and murder. For these crimes he was sentenced to be hanged in public on Friday, December 2, UNK Upon receiving the news, Northern writers, UNK and clergymen heaped UNK of murder on the Southern states, particularly Virginia. Although Rhode Islanders were preparing for the state elections, they watched John Brown's trial with extreme interest. On Wednesday morning, November 2, 1859, the Providence <Daily Journal> stated that although Brown justly deserved the extreme UNK no man, however UNK ought to suffer the penalty without a UNK trial. The UNK main criticism of the trial was the haste with which it was conducted. The readers of the Providence <Daily Post>, however, learned that it was generally conceded that "Old UNK had a fair trial. Concerning the sentence the editor asked, "What else can Virginia do than to hang the men who have defied her laws, organized treason, and UNK her UNK In the eastern section of the state the UNK reaction to Brown's trial and sentence were basically UNK J& UNK Smith, editor of the Warren UNK stated that "the ends of justice must be satisfied, a solitary example must be set, in order that all those UNK UNK UNK who, UNK by a blind UNK dare to UNK UNK treason, and murder, may heed it and shape their future course UNK The editor of the Newport UNK could discover no evidence of UNK circumstances in the Brown trial which would warrant making an exception to the UNK of capital punishment. In direct contrast to the other Rhode Island UNK Samuel S& Foss of the Woonsocket <Patriot> UNK condemned the trial as being completely UNK Concerning the sentence, Foss wrote, "If it be possible **h that mercy shall UNK vengeance **h and that John Brown's sentence shall be UNK to UNK it would be well- well for the country **h and for UNK Despite the excitement being caused by the trial and sentence of John Brown, Rhode Islanders turned their attention to the state elections. The state had elected Republican candidates in the past two years. There was no doubt as to the control the Republican party exercised throughout the state. If it failed on occasion to elect its candidates for general state offices by UNK the failure was due to a lingering UNK of the UNK party, which called itself the American Republican party. The American Republicans and the Republicans both nominated UNK Turner for governor. UNK R& UNK was the Democratic candidate. The results of the election of UNK found Republican candidates not only winning the offices of governor and UNK but also obtaining the two Congressional offices from the eastern and western sections of the state. During the month of November hardly a day passed when there was not some mention of John Brown in the Rhode Island newspapers. On November 7, 1859, the Providence <Daily Journal> UNK a letter sent to John Brown from "E& B&", a Quaker lady in UNK In reference to Brown's raid she wrote, UNK we are UNK and religiously believe it better to reform by moral and not by UNK weapons **h we know UNK was UNK UNK by the most generous and philanthropic UNK "E& UNK compared John Brown to Moses in that they were both acting to deliver millions from UNK In contrast to "E& B&", most Rhode Islanders hardly thought of John Brown as being another UNK Most attempts to develop any sympathy for Brown and his actions found an UNK audience in Rhode Island. On Wednesday evening, November 23, 1859, in Warren, Rev& Mark Trafton of New UNK gave a UNK of UNK lecture in which he favorably viewed the Harper's Ferry UNK The Warren UNK stated that many of Rev& UNK remarks were inappropriate and UNK strongly of UNK and UNK In its account of the Trafton lecture, the Providence <Daily Post> said that the remarks of Rev& Trafton made the people UNK No sympathy or admiration for Brown could be found in the Providence <Daily Post>, for the editor claimed that there were a score of men in the state prison who were a thousand times more UNK of UNK The Providence <Daily UNK however, stated that Brown's courage, UNK and heroism "in a good cause would make a man a UNK it gives something of dignity even to a bad one". The Woonsocket <Patriot> admitted that John Brown might deserve punishment or imprisonment "but he should no more be hung than Henry A& Wise or James UNK The Newport UNK exhibited more concern over the possibility of the UNK making a martyr of Brown than it did over the development of sympathy for him. In her letter to John Brown, "E& B&", the UNK from Newport, had suggested that the American people owed more honor to John Brown for seeking to free the slaves than they did to George Washington. During the latter days of November to the day of Brown's execution, it seems that most Rhode Islanders did not concur in "E& UNK suggestion. On November 22, 1859, the Providence <Daily Journal> stated that although Brown's UNK and honest UNK must be UNK any honor paid to Brown would only induce other UNK to imitate his actions. A week later the <Daily Journal> had discovered the initial plans of some Providence citizens to hold a meeting honoring John Brown on the day of his UNK The editor of the <Daily Journal> UNK "**h that if such a demonstration be made, it will not find support or countenance from any of the men whose names are recognized as having a right to speak for UNK The Providence <Daily UNK editor wrote that he could not believe that a meeting honoring Brown was to be held in Providence. He further called upon the people of Providence to UNK the meeting and avoid UNK On December 2, 1859, John Brown was hanged at Charles UNK Virginia. UNK precautions were taken so that no stranger be allowed in the city and no citizen within the enclosure surrounding the UNK In many Northern towns and cities meetings were held and church bells were UNK Such was not the case in Rhode Island. The <only> public demonstration in honor of John Brown was held at UNK Hall in Providence, on the day of his UNK Despite the opposition of the city newspapers, the Pratt Hall meeting UNK together a very respectable audience, composed in part of those who had been distinguished for years for their radical views upon the subject of slavery, of many of our colored citizens, and of those who were attracted to the place by the novelty of such a UNK UNK on the platform were Amos C& UNK UNK of Providence and a wealthy Republican stove UNK Thomas Davis, an uncompromising UNK the Reverend Augustus UNK a Unitarian UNK the Reverend George T& Day, a UNK UNK Daniel UNK UNK and William H& H& UNK The latter two were appointed UNK The first speaker was Amos C& UNK who had been unanimously chosen president of the meeting. He spoke of his desire to promote the abolition of slavery by UNK means and he compared John Brown of Harper's Ferry to the John Brown of Rhode Island's colonial period. UNK concluded that as Rhode Island's John Brown became a UNK hero, if not a UNK so would it be with John Brown of Harper's UNK The next speaker was George T& Day. Although admitting Brown's guilt on legal grounds, Day said that, UNK is no common UNK his deed was not below, but above the law". Following Day was UNK who spoke of his disapproval of Brown's attempt at UNK UNK his admiration of Brown's character, and his opposition to slavery. UNK remarks were UNK by a portion of the audience several times and once there was UNK The fourth and last speaker was Thomas UNK By this time large numbers of the audience had left the hall. Davis commenced his remarks by an UNK to the general feeling of opposition which the meeting had encountered from many of the citizens and all the newspapers of the city. He said that the propriety or UNK of such a gathering was a question that was to be settled by every man in accordance with the convictions of private judgments. In the remainder of his speech Davis spoke of his admiration for Brown and warned those who took part in the meeting that they "are liable to the charge that they are supporting UNK and upholding men whom the laws have UNK He recalled that in Rhode Island a party opposed to the state's condemnation of a man UNK W& UNK proclaimed the state's action as a violation of the law of the land and the principles of human liberty. At the close of UNK speech the following UNK and resolutions were read by the president, and on the question of their adoption passed UNK UNK John Brown has UNK UNK his life in UNK to deliver those who are denied all rights **h and is this day doomed to suffer death for his efforts in behalf of those who have no UNK Therefore, Resolved that, while we most UNK disapprove the methods he adopted to accomplish his objects, yet **h in his willingness to die in aid of the great cause of human freedom, we still recognize the qualities of a noble nature and the exercise of a spirit which true men have always admired and which history never fails to honor. Resolved that his wrongs and UNK in Kansas, occasioned by the violence and brutality of those who were intent on the propagation of slavery in that territory, call for a charitable judgment upon his recent efforts in Virginia to undermine the UNK from which he had suffered, and commend his family to the special sympathy and aid of all who pity suffering and reverence justice. Resolved **h that the anti-slavery sentiment is becoming ripe for resolute action.

On the morning following the Pratt Hall meeting the editor of the Providence <Daily Journal> wrote that although the meeting was milder and less extreme than those held in other areas for similar purposes, it could have been avoided completely. Rather than being UNK the eye is UNK instead of seeing objects in space, it sees nothing more UNK a picture. Through UNK and 1912, as the Cubist UNK tendency to adhere to the literal surface became harder and harder to UNK the task of keeping the surface at UNK length fell all the more to UNK UNK To UNK and sometimes to UNK the simulated UNK Braque and Picasso began to mix sand and other foreign substances with their UNK the UNK texture thus created likewise called attention to the reality of the surface and was effective over much larger areas. In certain other UNK however, Braque began to paint areas in exact UNK of wood UNK or UNK These areas by virtue of their abrupt density of pattern, stated the literal surface with such new and superior force that the resulting contrast drove the simulated printing into a depth from which it could be UNK and set to UNK again- only by conventional UNK that is, by being placed in such relation to the forms depicted within the illusion that these forms left no room for the UNK except near the surface. The accumulation of such devices, however, soon had the effect of UNK even while UNK surface and depth. The process of UNK seemed UNK and it became necessary to emphasize the surface still further in order to prevent it from UNK with the illusion. It was for this reason, and no other that I can see, that in September 1912, Braque took the radical and revolutionary step of UNK actual pieces of UNK wallpaper to a drawing on paper, instead of trying to simulate its texture in paint. Picasso says that he himself had already made his first collage toward the end of UNK when he glued a piece of UNK UNK to a painting on UNK It is true that his first collage looks more Analytical than UNK which would confirm the date he assigns it. But it is also true that Braque was the consistent pioneer in the use of simulated textures as well as of UNK and moreover, he had already begun to broaden and simplify the facet-planes of Analytical Cubism as far back as the end of UNK ## When we examine what each master says was his first collage we see that much the same thing happens in each. UNK makes no real difference that Braque's collage is on paper and UNK out in UNK while Picasso's is on canvas and UNK out in UNK By its greater UNK presence and its greater UNK the affixed paper or cloth serves for a seeming moment to push everything else into a more vivid <idea> of depth than the simulated printing or simulated textures had ever done. But here again, the UNK device both UNK and falls short of its aim. For the illusion of depth created by the contrast between the affixed material and everything else gives way immediately to an illusion of forms in UNK which gives way in turn, and with equal UNK to an illusion that seems to contain UNK or neither. Because of the size of the areas it covers, the pasted paper establishes undepicted flatness UNK as more than an indication or sign. UNK flatness now tends to assert itself as the main event of the picture, and the device UNK the illusion of depth is rendered even more precarious than before. Instead of isolating the literal flatness by specifying and UNK it, the pasted paper or cloth releases and spreads it, and the artist seems to have nothing left but this undepicted flatness with which to finish as well as start his picture. The actual surface becomes both ground and background, and it turns out- suddenly and UNK that the only place left for a three-dimensional illusion is in UNK of, UNK the surface. In their very first UNK Braque and Picasso draw or paint UNK and <on> the affixed paper or cloth, so that certain of the principal features of their subjects <as UNK seem to thrust out into UNK UNK UNK or to be about to do so- while the rest of the subject remains imbedded in, or flat upon, the surface. And the surface is driven back, in its very UNK only by this contrast. In the upper center of Braque's first collage, UNK UNK (in Douglas UNK UNK a bunch of grapes is rendered with such UNK vivid UNK effect as to lift it practically off the picture plane. The UNK illusion here is no longer enclosed between parallel UNK but seems to thrust through the surface of the drawing paper and establish depth <on UNK of it. Yet the violent immediacy of the wallpaper strips pasted to the paper, and the only lesser immediacy of block capitals that simulate window UNK manage somehow to push the UNK cluster back into place on the picture plane so that it does not UNK At the same time, the wallpaper strips themselves seem to be pushed into depth by the lines and patches of shading UNK upon them, and by their placing in relation to the block UNK and these capitals seem in turn to be pushed back by <their> UNK and by contrast with the UNK of the UNK Thus every part and plane of the picture keeps changing place in relative depth with every other part and plane; and it is as if the only stable relation left among the different parts of the picture is the ambivalent and ambiguous one that each has with the surface. And the same thing, more or less, can be said of the contents of Picasso's first UNK In later UNK of both UNK a variety of extraneous materials are used, sometimes in the same work, and almost always in conjunction with every other UNK and UNK device they can think of. The area adjacent to one edge of a piece of affixed UNK or simply of a UNK UNK will be shaded to pry that edge away from the surface, while something will be drawn, painted or even pasted over another part of the same shape to drive it back into depth. UNK defined as parallel to the surface also cut through it into real space, and a depth is suggested UNK which is greater than that established UNK All this UNK the UNK between surface and depth so as to encompass UNK space in front of the surface as well as behind it. UNK may now monopolize everything, but it is a flatness become so ambiguous and expanded as to turn into illusion itself- at least an optical if not, properly speaking, a pictorial illusion. UNK Cubist flatness is now almost completely UNK to the UNK undepicted kind, but at the same time it UNK upon and largely transforms the undepicted kind- and it does so, moreover, without UNK the latter of its UNK rather, it UNK and reinforces that UNK UNK it. ## Out of this UNK UNK the Cubist subject UNK For it had turned out, by a further paradox of Cubism, that the means to an illusion of depth and plasticity had now become widely divergent from the means of representation or UNK In the Analytical phase of their Cubism, Braque and Picasso had not only had to minimize UNK simply in order to preserve it; they had also had to UNK it- to the point, finally, where the illusion of depth and relief became UNK from specific three-dimensional entities and was rendered largely as the illusion of depth and relief <as UNK as a UNK attribute and UNK property detached from everything not itself. In order to be saved, plasticity had had to be UNK and as the aspect of the subject was transposed into those clusters of more or less interchangeable and UNK facet-planes by which plasticity was isolated under the Cubist method, the subject itself became largely UNK Cubism, in its UNK phase (which the French, with justice, call UNK was on the UNK of abstract art. It was then that Picasso and Braque were confronted with a unique UNK they had to choose UNK illusion and representation. If they UNK for illusion, it could only be illusion per UNK an illusion of depth, and of relief, so general and UNK as to exclude the representation of individual objects. If, on the other hand, they UNK for UNK it had to be representation per UNK representation as image pure and simple, without connotations (at least, without more than UNK UNK of the three-dimensional space in which the objects represented originally existed. It was the collage that made the terms of this dilemma clear: the UNK could be restored and preserved only on the flat and literal surface now that illusion and representation had become, for the first time, mutually exclusive alternatives. In the end, Picasso and Braque UNK for the UNK and it would seem they did so UNK (This provides whatever real justification there is for the talk about UNK But the UNK formal logic of Cubism, as it worked itself out through the collage, had just as much to do with shaping their decision. When the smaller facet-planes of Analytical Cubism were placed upon or UNK with the large, dense shapes formed by the affixed materials of the collage, they had to UNK become UNK into larger UNK shapes themselves simply in order to maintain the integrity of the picture plane. UNK in their previous UNK UNK they would have cut away too abruptly into UNK and the broad, opaque shapes of pasted paper would have been isolated in such a way as to make them jump out of plane. Large planes UNK with other large planes tend to assert themselves as UNK shapes, and to the extent that they are flat, they also assert themselves as UNK and independent UNK are apt to coincide with the recognizable contours of the subject from which a picture starts (if it does start from a UNK It was because of this UNK as much as for any other reason- that is, because of the growing independence of the UNK unit in collage as a UNK that the identity of depicted objects, or at least parts of them, UNK in Braque's and Picasso's UNK UNK and continued to remain more conspicuous UNK but only as flattened UNK than in any of their paintings done wholly in oil before the end of 1913. Analytical Cubism came to an end in the collage, but not UNK nor did UNK Cubism fully begin there. Only when the collage had been UNK translated into oil, and transformed by this UNK did Cubism become an affair of positive color and flat, interlocking UNK whose UNK and placement created allusions to, if not the illusion of, unmistakable three-dimensional UNK UNK Cubism began with Picasso alone, late in 1913 or early in UNK this was the point at which he finally took the lead in Cubist innovation away from UNK never again to relinquish it. But even before that, Picasso had UNK and UNK for a moment, a certain revolutionary path in which no one had preceded him. It was as though, in that instant, he had felt the flatness of collage as too UNK and had suddenly tried to escape all the way back- or UNK to literal UNK This he did by using utterly literal means to carry the forward push of the collage (and of Cubism in UNK UNK into the literal space in front of the picture plane. Some time in 1912, Picasso cut out and folded a piece of paper in the shape of a UNK to this he glued and fitted other pieces of paper and four taut UNK thus creating a sequence of flat surfaces in real and UNK space to which there clung only the UNK of a picture plane. The affixed elements of collage were UNK as it were, and cut off from the literal pictorial surface to form a UNK UNK Angeles in 1957 finally bowed to the UNK And without high density in the core, UNK systems cannot be maintained UNK let alone built from scratch at today's prices. However, the building of freeways and garages cannot continue forever. The new interchange among the four Los Angeles UNK including the UNK UNK occupies by itself no less than UNK UNK of downtown land, UNK of a square UNK an area about the size of Rockefeller Center in New York. It is hard to believe that this mass of UNK concrete constitutes what the law calls "the highest and best UNK of centrally located urban land. As it affects the city's fiscal situation, such an interchange is UNK it removes forever from the tax rolls property which should be taxed to pay for the city services. UNK improved land values without taking away UNK freeways boost valuation less (because the garages they require are not prime buildings by a long UNK and reduce the acreage that can be UNK UNK Los Angeles is already two-thirds UNK UNK street, parking lot and UNK one of those preposterous UNK statistics has already come to pass. The freeway with narrowly spaced UNK concentrates and UNK the access problem, but it also acts inevitably as an UNK isolating UNK City planners do not always use this boundary as effectively as they UNK Less ambitious freeway plans may be more UNK especially when the UNK and UNK are UNK allowing for cross access at many points and providing parking areas below the UNK ## Meanwhile, the automobile and its friend the truck have cost the central city some of its industrial dominance. In ever greater numbers, factories are locating in the suburbs or in UNK UNK removed from the city's political jurisdiction. The appeal of the suburb is particularly strong for heavy industry, which must move bulky objects along a lengthy assembly line and wants enough land area to do the entire job on one floor. To light industry, the economies of being on one floor are much UNK but efficiency engineers usually believe in them, and manufacturers looking for ways to cut costs cannot be prevented from turning to efficiency engineers. This movement of industry away from the central cities is not so UNK new as some prophets seem to believe. It is merely the latest example of the UNK growth which formed the pattern of virtually all American cities. The big factories which are relatively near the centers of our cities- the rubber factories in UNK UNK Detroit plants, UNK Pittsburgh UNK often began on these sites at a time when UNK was the edge of the city, yet close to transport UNK storage UNK and power UNK The UNK was a phenomenon of the railroad and the steam UNK and the time when the belts of residence surrounding the old factory area were not yet UNK The truck and the car gave the manufacturer a new degree of freedom in selecting his plant site. Until internal combustion became cheap, he had to be near a railroad siding and a trolley line or an existing large community of lower-class homes. The railroad siding is still important- it is usually, though not always, true that UNK UNK by rail is cheaper than UNK But anybody who promises a substantial volume of business can get a railroad to run a short spur to his plant these days, and many businesses can live without the UNK And there are now many millions of workers for whom the factory with the big parking lot, which can be reached by driving across or against the usual pattern of rush hour traffic and UNK bus lines, is actually more convenient than the UNK UNK UNK UNK General UNK enormous installations at Louisville and UNK the UNK Boeing in Seattle, Douglas and Lockheed in Los Angeles, the new automobile assembly plants UNK none of these is substantially served by any sort of conventional mass rapid UNK They are all suburban plants, relying on the roads to keep them supplied with workers. And wherever the new UNK go up their banks are lined by neat glass and metal and colored brick light industry. The drive along Massachusetts' Route UNK the UNK which makes an arc about twenty miles from downtown Boston, may be a vision of the future. The future could be worse. The plants along Route UNK are mostly well designed and nicely set against the New England rocks and trees. They can even be rather UNK like Edward UNK monument to the astonishing success of UNK But they deny the values of the UNK the UNK UNK tolerant city, the UNK UNK which gave off so many of the most admirable American qualities. They are segregated businesses, combining again on one site the factory and the office, drawing their work force from segregated communities. It is interesting to note how many of the plants on Massachusetts' Route UNK draw most of their income either from the government in UNK UNK UNK or from the exploitation of patents which grant at least a partial monopoly. ## While the factories were always the center of the labor market, they were often on the city's UNK In spreading the factories even farther, the automobile may not have changed to any great extent the growth pattern of the cities. Even the loss of hotel business to the UNK motel has been relatively UNK the UNK UNK is becoming harder to find every year. What UNK most is the damage the automobile has done to UNK retailing, especially in those cities where public transit is UNK Some retailing, of course, always spreads with the UNK grocery stores, UNK local UNK and dress shops, candy stores and the like. But whenever a major purchase was UNK forty years UNK a new bedroom set or a winter coat, an Easter UNK a bicycle for UNK the family set off for the downtown department store, where the selection would be UNK Department stores UNK in the "one hundred per cent UNK where all the transit lines UNK These stores are still there, but the volume of the UNK UNK has been on a relative decline, while in many cities the suburban UNK sells more and more dry goods. If the UNK and UNK downtown unit sales have been UNK however, his dollar volume continues to rise, and it is dollars which you put in the bank. In most discussions of this phenomenon, the figures are substantially UNK No suburban UNK UNK not even Hudson's vast UNK outside UNK does anything like the unit volume of business or carries anything like the variety of merchandise to be found in the home store. Telephone orders distort the UNK the UNK naturally calls a local rather than a UNK number if both are listed in an UNK especially if the local call eliminates city sales tax. The suburban branch is thereby credited with a sale which would have been made even if its glass doors had never opened. UNK procedures which continue to charge a UNK overhead and warehouse expense to the main store make the branches seem more profitable than they are. In many cases that statement "We break even on our downtown operation and make money on our UNK would be turned around if the cost analysis were UNK on terms less UNK to the old store. UNK of the UNK always a great motivating force in the American UNK makes retailers who do <not> have suburban operations exaggerate both the volume and the UNK of their UNK shiny new branches. The fact seems to be that very many large branch stores are UNK that the choice of location in the suburbs is as important as it was UNK and that even highly UNK cities will support only so many big branches. Moreover, the cost of operations is always high in UNK new store, as the conservative bankers who act as UNK for retail giants are beginning to UNK When all has been said, however, the big branch store remains a major break with history in the development of American UNK Just as the suburban factory may be more convenient than the downtown plant to the worker with a car, the trip to the shopping center may seem far easier than to the downtown department store, though both are the same distance from home. Indeed, there are some cities where the suburban shopping pulls customers who are geographically much nearer to downtown. Raymond Vernon reports that residents of East St& Louis have been driving across the Mississippi, through the heart of downtown St& Louis and out to the western suburbs for major shopping, simply because parking is easier at the big branches than it is in the heart of town. To the extent that the problem is merely UNK an aggressive downtown management, like that of UNK UNK in Columbus, Ohio, can fight back successfully by building a garage on the lot next door. If the distant patron of the suburban branch has been frightened away from downtown by traffic problems, however, the city store can only pressure the politicians to do something about the highways or await the completion of the federal highway program. And if the affection for the suburban branch reflects a desire to shop with UNK people", rather than with the indiscriminate urban mass which supports the downtown department store, the central location may be in serious trouble. Today, according to land economist Homer UNK shopping centers and their associated parking lots cover some UNK acres of land, which is almost exactly the total land area in all the nation's Central Business UNK put together. The downtown store continues to offer the great UNK of variety, both within its gates and across the street, where other department stores are immediately convenient for the UNK who wants to see what is available before making up her mind. If anything may be predicted in the UNK world of retailing, it seems likely that the suburban branch will come to dominate children's clothing UNK the kid downtown is too much of a UNK household UNK and the discount business in UNK items. Department stores were built on dry goods, especially ladies' UNK and in this area, in the long run, the suburban branches will be hard put to compete against downtown. If this analysis is correct, the suburban branches will turn out to be what UNK cost UNK refuse to UNK marginal operations rather than major factors. UNK in America the appeal of cities has been their color and life, the variety of experience they UNK "How UNK gonna keep 'em down on the UNK was a question that had to be asked long before they saw UNK Though Americans usually lived in groups segregated by national origin or religious belief, they liked to work and shop in the noise and vitality of downtown. Only a radical change in the nature of the population in the central city would be likely to destroy this UNK and we must now turn our attention to the question of whether such a change, UNK foreseen by so many urban UNK is actually upon us. #4. UNK AND UNK In their book <American UNK Christopher UNK and Henry Hope Reed argue that Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal was what made the modern suburb a UNK a fine UNK argument, when you consider how UNK tend to vote. The first UNK New York's Henry Hudson and Chicago's Lake Shore, San Francisco's Bay Bridge and its UNK a good slice of the Pennsylvania UNK were built as part of the federal works program which was going to cure the UNK At the same time, Roosevelt's Federal Housing Administration, coupled with Henry UNK UNK policy, permitted ordinary lower-middle-class families to build their own homes. Bankers who had been reluctant to lend without better security than the house itself got that security from the U& S& government; UNK who had been unable to pick up the burden of short-term UNK mortgages found they could borrow for twenty-five years at 4 per cent, under government UNK Before losing itself in the sands of the 19th Century, the grand stream of Italian Renaissance architectural decoration made a last appearance in the Brumidi UNK of the Capitol Rotunda in Washington. The artistic generation after Brumidi was trained in the Paris of that time to a more UNK standard of execution, and tended to overlook greatness of conception where faults and weakness were easy to find. But it is a great UNK The open ceiling, with allegorical and classical figures thrown in masses against the UNK the closed frieze, formally divided into historical scenes and tightly tied to the stone walls, belong in their large ordering to the line of UNK and his UNK UNK The descent may be remote, but this is surely the only UNK example of that vigorous UNK in the United States. UNK Brumidi designed the decorative scheme as a whole, in collaboration with the architect Charles U& UNK at the time when plans were being made to replace the wooden dome of UNK with the present much larger iron structure. After many years and many UNK he was able to finish the UNK fresco, and slightly less than half the frieze, beginning with the Liberty group opposite the East door, and ending with William UNK all but one leg, when a tragic accident ended his career. He left at his death UNK drawn to scale, for the rest of the circle. These were carried out not too faithfully by UNK UNK who began by supplying the missing member to the founder of Pennsylvania and noting in UNK in UNK that he UNK at this UNK When Costaggini had used up all the sketches thirty-six feet of empty frieze were left over. A blank UNK UNK UNK in UNK disfigured the wall of the Rotunda until 1951. Then, advised by the UNK of the UNK the Joint Committee for the UNK traditionally responsible for the works of art in the building, ordered the space cleared and painted in fresco, to show "the Peace after the Civil UNK "the UNK UNK and "the UNK of UNK to match as nearly as feasible Brumidi's technique and composition. Later the cleaning and restoration were ordered, first of the older part of the frieze, finally of the UNK What follows is therefore a description of three separate UNK the new UNK of the UNK and the successive essays in UNK with some discussion of problems that arose in connection with each. For the use of students and future UNK a full, day-by-day record was kept of all three UNK complete technical reports on what we found and what we did. These may be consulted in the office of the UNK of the UNK or the Library of Congress. The first preliminary was UNK the UNK length of frieze, a jumble of UNK and finish UNK all in bad condition. It was decided to strip the whole area down to the UNK and to replace the rough coats up to one inch thickness to agree with the older artists' preparation, with a UNK one part slaked lime, three parts UNK to be put on in two UNK UNK were drawn full size, after sketches had been made to satisfy all the UNK There was some difficulty here. One had to manage the given subjects, three diverse recent events, so as to make them part of a classical UNK that is, a pattern of large figures filling the space, with not much else, against a blank background. Moreover, all three representations must be squeezed comfortably into little more than the length Brumidi allowed for each one of his. When it was all arranged to fit, and not to interrupt the lengthwise flow of movement in the frieze, the cartoons were tried in place. The UNK a confusion of heavy beams hanging from the gallery above, was strong and UNK but UNK UNK Nothing could be seen from the floor, but by moving around the gallery one could get UNK and we were able to decide on some UNK of scale. To be sure of matching color as well as form, pieces of UNK were traced on the UNK and large samples painted in fresco, then left two months to dry out to their final key. Later it was gratifying to note that they had set so solidly as to be hard to remove when the time came. The UNK was the length of the space to be UNK What bits of Brumidi and Costaggini could be reached at either end seemed in good order, though the UNK UNK surface was thick with dust. UNK they came out surprisingly clear and bright. It could be seen that both artists used a very thick final coat of plaster, one half UNK and that both followed the traditional Italian fresco technique as described by UNK UNK in the 14th Century, and current in Italy to this day. That is, they used opaque color UNK getting solid highlights with active lime white. UNK "a UNK is much in evidence. A brown hatching reinforces and UNK UNK and much of the background is solidly covered with a dark coat. This brown is sometimes so rich in medium as to appear to be oil paint. In our own practice, to have the last UNK plaster coat thick enough to UNK and at the same time to avoid fine UNK in drying, we found that it had to be put on in two UNK letting the first set UNK before applying the second. The mortar was three parts sand to two of UNK Some of the lime that is always on hand in the Capitol basement for plaster repairs was slaked several months for us; but to make it UNK of a really UNK consistency to avoid UNK we added a little UNK UNK hard on the hands, but we could see no other UNK I am told that a mortar longer slaked might have remained longer in condition for painting. As it was, it took the pigment well for six hours, enough for our purpose, and held it firmly in setting. It was obvious that to match UNK white must be mixed with all but the UNK UNK UNK white, hard and brilliant, has a tendency to UNK away from the other colors in drying, and also by its capacity to set, to preclude the use of ready-made UNK so useful in decorative work. In older Italian practice, lime, dried and UNK UNK UNK entered into such prepared UNK For convenience we chose a stronger UNK unknown to the early Italians or to UNK UNK UNK reserving the active lime white for highest UNK put on at the end of the day's UNK Other pigments were mostly raw umber, some burnt umber, and a little yellow UNK This last was probably not in Brumidi's UNK but was needed to take the UNK UNK look off the new work next to the old, where softening effects of time were seen, even after thorough UNK The use of UNK we tried to restrict to covering joints. Experience showed, however, that it is very difficult to paint a dark UNK background in fresco that will not dry out UNK and UNK Later Brumidi and Costaggini will be seen coping with this same problem. We were UNK as they were, to work a good deal of UNK into background and dark areas. We made it by UNK recipe, five parts thoroughly washed cheese UNK to one of lime UNK ground together they made a strong UNK which became UNK in UNK Figure 1 was taken in 1953. The new part is finished. On the right is the Brumidi Liberty group, as it looked after cleaning operations, which had not yet come around to the other end; where, of UNK only some foliage has been UNK at the point where his work stopped. One is led to speculate as to why the empty space was there, left for our century to finish. Costaggini said it was Brumidi's fault in not providing enough material to fill the circle. Brumidi's son later maintained that Costaggini had compressed and UNK his father's designs, UNK UNK a bit he could claim for his very own. This question might be settled by comparing the measurement of the actual UNK with the dimensions noted, presumably in Brumidi's hand, above the various sections of his long preparatory drawing, which has been kept. UNK ever fault, it is evident that Brumidi intended to fill out the whole frieze with his UNK and come full circle with the scene of the discovery of California UNK In painting a fresco, the handling of wet mortar UNK one always to move from top to bottom and from left to right, not to UNK yesterday's work with today's UNK At the very first, then, Brumidi was required, by the UNK UNK shape of his central group, to fill in the triangular space above the seated girl on UNK right, before starting on the allegorical figures themselves. Here he put a small man, whose missing hands might have left his function UNK until comparison with the first sketches showed that when the artist came back to the beginning, this was to be the closing figure of the party of UNK and was to hold a basket. One sees UNK rendering of the same figure more than thirty feet away. The UNK Figure 1 of the completed frieze, shows how, having been separated from his fellows in useless isolation for eighty years, he has now been given a hand, and by UNK (and the permission of the UNK given a new job, to represent the witnesses of the first flight at UNK Hawk in UNK The startlingly bright effect of the first UNK led the Committee to order the rest of the UNK cycle cleaned and restored to go with them. The fixed wooden UNK was removed, and, so as to reach all the frieze, one of pipe, on UNK built up from the floor. Every few days, in the early morning, as the work progressed, twenty men would appear to push it ahead and to shift the plank foundation that distributed its weight widely on the Rotunda UNK supported as it is by ancient brick UNK On this UNK and UNK platform over fifty feet from the floor, after a first UNK we began to wash. A most useful tool for wetting the surface without running down was made from a UNK UNK UNK nozzle UNK to a hose connection, to be used at low water pressure. A valve in the handle let us cut the pressure still lower. One man UNK with a sponge in hand to check excess UNK A second assistant UNK with two UNK In parts a repeated UNK was needed, but everywhere we found that water alone was enough to restore the original UNK No soap or other cleaning agent was used that might bring in unwanted chemical reactions. The painting "a UNK stood up UNK a little of the UNK came off. UNK UNK was put on at once. Altogether we found the craftsmanship first rate, especially UNK We were greatly helped by there being no traces of former UNK Apparently not more than UNK had ever been done, and not much of that. The plaster was sound, the UNK firmly attached all over, and the pigment solidly incorporated with it in all but a few unimportant places. The greatest source of trouble was rain which had repeatedly flowed from openings above, soaking the surface and leaving UNK of dissolved lime, very conspicuous even after cleaning, particularly in the UNK of UNK UNK and the UNK and UNK Here the UNK referring to the use of the Capitol as a public building, not a museum, requested some UNK to maintain decorative effect, rather than leaving UNK UNK UNK These UNK have had no care for eighty years. With naked gas jets below and UNK windows above, enough to ruin wall paintings in any medium, they have UNK in a building long UNK in winter, hot and damp under the iron dome in summer. Those whom I wish to address with this letter are for the most part unknown to me. It may well be that, when Rudy Pozzatti and I visited your country last spring, you were living and working close to the places we saw and the streets we UNK As American artists, it was natural that we would want to meet as many Soviet artists as possible. This letter might not have been necessary had our efforts to meet and talk with you been more successful. Even though we did not see many of your UNK it appears now quite evident that a considerable number of your profession heard, from those whom we had the fortune to UNK that we had been in your UNK I am very pleased that quite a number of you found ways to communicate to me your desire to hear of our reactions and experiences in the UNK I can well understand your curiosity. We, ourselves, are always eager to know how others feel about us and the way in which we live. it is my hope that this written message and report will reach you through the good offices of the Union of Soviet Artists. There should be no reason to UNK or ignore the intent of this letter. Pozzatti and I UNK earnestly to record our impressions without the prejudice that the anxiety of our time so easily UNK The UNK of little more than a month cannot entitle me to pose as an expert on anything I saw. Too much damage is done by UNK who have spent even less time, if any at all, in the UNK Nevertheless I consider it UNK because of my commitment as an artist, to assume that the rights and responsibilities of creative individuals are related to humanity as a whole rather than to specific UNK interests. If this attitude is seriously questioned in the Soviet Union, it does not necessarily follow that the majority of the society in which I live is too aware of the necessity for clarity on this ethical as well as aesthetic point of view. It is a matter of some disappointment to me that still many of my own UNK are too shortsighted to UNK any symbolic significance to the plight of a UNK such as artists, in any social order. I encountered many questions and great interest upon my return from the Soviet Union about my reactions to that experience. That which I found most profound and most disturbing appeared to evoke a curiously UNK reaction. Almost as if I were talking about something quite UNK Apparently this is not the time and the climate in which people will listen UNK or at least UNK to individual impressions of a subject which UNK a good deal of their waking moments. Personal predispositions tend to blunt the ear and, in turn, the voice as well. I cannot be content with the UNK small talk of a somewhat unusual UNK I am equally impatient with the UNK of the shoulder, shake of the head of those who no longer care because they have known it for so UNK the aggressive disbelief of those who are UNK lost in a semantic UNK of the word UNK the belligerent UNK by the sick UNK of ignorance who try to build a UNK wall of UNK on our physical horizons. UNK as it may have been at times, Pozzatti and I saw enough, talked to enough artists, historians and others to realize that the issue is quite clear. Artists and poets are the raw UNK of UNK they are small in number and their contribution is not immediately decisive in everyday life. By themselves they may not be able to save the life on this UNK but without them there would be very little left worth UNK It cannot be said that our very first day in the Soviet Union turned out to be an ordinary one. On that cold, but bright, April day we were guests of your government in the reviewing stand of Red Square to witness the UNK celebration for Yuri UNK and later on that day we attended the somewhat more exclusive reception for him in one of the impressive palaces of the UNK If we thus spent our very first day in the midst of a large number of your people honoring a new hero and a great national achievement, our last day, to us at least, was equally impressive and very moving, even though the crowds were absent and there was almost complete silence. We stood under a gigantic tree in the rolling country just outside of Moscow looking at silent flowers on the grave of a Russian poet and writer who cherished the love for his country to the point of foregoing the highest international honor. The grave, about UNK between his home and the blue UNK of a small church, rose above the forms and spaces of gently undisciplined UNK of green, the sounds of birds, the silence of other UNK and the casual paths through small forests. Just yesterday we had met and talked with a living writer, a contemporary of the dead poet, who is known for his ability of UNK his ideas and his craft more UNK But today we were aware of only two men. One had taken a flight into uncharted space, in the service of science, to return as a living hero. The other had assumed the right to explore the equally uncharted space of the human spirit. The flowers on his grave attested to the fact that he as well was somebody's hero. These two UNK form the frame around a series of experiences and sights which, to me at least, symbolize the extremes in the aesthetic as well as ethical conflict between materialism and UNK A struggle that is being waged all over the world in the UNK of UNK The prevalent opinion which we encountered in a variety of expressions in your country denied not only the existence of this conflict but it was elaborated even further with an incredible semantic UNK The socialist environment, it was stated, had UNK these two extreme seeds and was about to produce a new plant and fruit. When I UNK on one such occasion that the new growth, like other UNK might be unable to UNK I was immediately accused of preaching racial UNK I could not bring myself to answer that UNK of my best friends are UNK UNK This kind of reasoning and logic takes a little time to get used to. After a while we were perhaps less UNK but still UNK when a friendly discussion would suddenly jump the track into the most irrelevant and UNK UNK A chance remark about UNK sealed train brought the UNK that this was a myth akin to George Washington's UNK tree. UNK of the behavior pattern of population masses were compared to scientific discoveries concerning the UNK of UNK masses. No wonder that Pozzatti and I had at times difficulty in remembering the real purpose of our presence, namely, Cultural UNK UNK of such an experience was the occasion of a somewhat formal official welcome in the offices of the Union of Soviet Artists. We had looked forward to what we hoped to be our first informal meeting with a number of Moscow's artists. Instead, we became involved in a series of friendly, but overly UNK welcoming addresses to which we had no choice but to reply in kind. The terms of friendship, understanding, cooperation, etc&, tend to become somewhat UNK because of constant and indiscriminate use. I can only hope that the continuing exchange of groups and individuals between our countries will not wear out all language pertinent to the occasion. The presiding female UNK of massive proportions and UNK appearance, initially did not contribute to the expressions of friendship and welcome by a number of dignified gentlemen representing the arts. It was only after we had UNK with what I fear were similar UNK that she went into action by questioning our desire for friendship and understanding with a challenge about aggressive and warlike actions by the U&S& Government in Cuba and Laos. She UNK by leaving the room when we suggested that our meeting might well terminate right then and there. UNK she returned later, just as I had taken advantage of the UNK atmosphere in the room by stating that perhaps an unexpected result of the Cultural Exchange Program would be the UNK of UNK Art in Russia, with Social UNK regaining dominance in the U&S&. This gave her an opportunity to ring down the curtain with the UNK UNK that we should not presume to lecture her on UNK She did not go so far as to say, as was done on other occasions, that UNK as well as UNK were a Russian invention that had been discarded as unwanted by the people of the UNK UNK and I could not know then that we would experience this sort of treatment more often in Moscow than elsewhere. We were to UNK in fact, that quite a number of people share with us the impression that, in contrast to other Soviet UNK Moscow's atmosphere is UNK subdued and official. To have one's intentions deliberately or UNK UNK is always a waste of time. Until our Moscow experience, I had not considered it necessary to prepare any argument formally or UNK Artists simply do not talk to each other in that UNK and, UNK I could not presume the implication that I spoke for American artists as a group. To save time, some clarification seemed necessary. The following is a statement read to a large and friendly group of your fellow artists in UNK "We have come to your land with the express intention of understanding and respecting your ideas and your ways. Our presence here should also be considered further, sincere evidence of the attempts by our people and their chosen government to seek any and all possible ways to effect UNK peaceful ties among all people. We are quite convinced that one of the main hopes for the future depends upon the informal contacts and exchanges of ideas between individuals. In spite of the relatively short period of time that we have experienced among you, we have already seen many indications of your character and spirit. We are acutely aware that yours is a society which, in spite of several wars and many UNK has developed itself into one of the foremost nations of the world. Your past history is UNK with the fruits of the intellect. Your present history is equally admirable for its industrial and scientific achievements. We have come to you to experience something of your way of life while also attempting to acquaint you with that of ours. While we, as American artists, believe deeply in the universal character of all intellectual activity, we would be less than honest with you, or ourselves, if we failed to state a specific attitude toward our own society as well as the international community as a whole. In stating this position, we should like to make it clear to you that we cannot expect artists and intellectuals in other lands to share our opinion in every respect. As a matter of fact, we prize the diversity among our own people so much that we will not presume to speak for all other American artists. But certainly, all will agree that it is not so much the knowledge and search for UNK between you and us, but rather the thoughtful exploration and acceptance of our differences which may lead us to our respective and desired goals with a minimum of UNK Like UNK we have pride and love for our country. To many of us, this is a land to which we or our parents fled from totalitarian terror in order to live in dignified freedom. As artists we feel the same UNK as do other individuals, in considering ourselves responsible citizens of a great nation. ## <The Sane UNK is an ambitious work. Its scope is as broad as the question: What does it mean to live in modern UNK A work so broad, even when it is directed by a leading idea and informed by a moral vision, must necessarily UNK Even a hasty reader will easily find in it numerous blind spots, errors of fact and argument, important UNK areas of ignorance and UNK undue UNK on UNK examples of broad positions supported by UNK evidence, and the like. Such books are easy prey for critics. Nor need the critic be UNK a careful and orderly man, who values precision and a kind of tough intellectual responsibility, might easily be put off by such a book. It is a simple matter, for one so UNK to take a work like <The Sane UNK and UNK it into odds and ends. The thing can be made to look like the UNK attic of a large and vigorous family- a motley jumble of discarded objects, some UNK and some that were never useful, some once whole and bright but now UNK and UNK some odd pieces whose history no one remembers, here and there a UNK everything fascinating because it suggests some part of the human UNK the whole adding up to nothing more than a glimpse into the UNK history of the makers and UNK That could be easily done, but there is little reason in it. It would come down to saying that Fromm paints with a broad brush, and that, after all, is not a conclusion one must work toward but an impression he has from the UNK I mention these features of the book because they are inherent in the book's character and therefore must be mentioned. It would be UNK to build a UNK around them. There are more substantial criticisms to be made of Fromm's account of capitalist civilization. It is worthwhile to recall that Fromm's treatment has both descriptive and UNK aspects. Since I have already discussed his moral position, that discussion is incorporated by reference into the following pages, which will focus on the empirical and analytic side of Fromm's treatment. I shall first indicate a couple of weaknesses in Fromm's analysis, then argue that, granted these UNK he still has much left that is UNK and, finally, raise the general question of a philosophical versus a sociological approach to the question of alienation. Almost no empirical work has been done on the problem of alienation. Despite its rather long intellectual history, alienation is still a promising hypothesis and not a verified theory. The idea has received much attention in philosophy, in literature, and in a few works of general social criticism, such as <The Sane UNK What is missing is work that would answer, presumably by the use of survey methods and UNK attitude UNK such questions as these: What are the components of the UNK described as UNK How widespread is UNK What is its incidence among the various classes and subgroups of the UNK Taking alienation as a dependent variable, with what UNK factors is it most highly UNK UNK as an independent variable, how does it affect behavior in various sectors of life? Until such work is done, there must remain the nagging suspicion that alienation may be little more than an expression of the malaise of the intellectual, who, rejected by and in turn rejecting the larger society, projects his own fear and despair onto the broader social screen. I am not suggesting that Fromm ought to do this kind of work. Nor do I think that alienation is nothing more than a projection of the malaise of the UNK I am saying only that until a fuller and different kind of evidence comes in, any discussion of alienation must be understood to have certain important limitations. Until such evidence UNK we must make do with the evidence we have. Here, perhaps, Fromm is UNK for he does not always use the best and most recent evidence available, and he sometimes selects and interprets the evidence in rather special ways. Three examples follow. Fromm's analysis of alienation in the sphere of production centers around the concepts of the UNK of the corporation, the separation of ownership from control, and the broad (and thus from the point of view of corporate control, UNK dispersion of stock ownership. For all these points he relies exclusively on UNK and UNK study of UNK <The Modern Corporation and Private UNK The broad conclusions of that UNK work remain UNK but subsequent research has expanded and somewhat altered their empirical support, has suggested important revisions in the general analytic frame of reference, and has UNK the meaning of particular analytic concepts in this area. Fromm seems unaware of these developments. Another example is his very UNK use of the large amount of data from surveys designed to discover what and how people actually do feel and think on a broad range of UNK he cites such UNK findings just three times. Moreover, the conclusions he draws from the findings are not always the only ones possible. For example, he cites the following data from two studies on job UNK in the first study, 85 per cent of professionals and UNK 64 per cent of white collar people, and 41 per cent of factory workers expressed satisfaction with their UNK in the second study, the percentages were 86 for professionals, 74 for managerial persons, 42 for commercial employees, 56 for skilled workers, and 48 for UNK workers. He concludes that these data show a UNK UNK percentage of consciously dissatisfied and unhappy persons among factory and clerical workers. Starting from other value premises than UNK some analysts might conclude that the percentages really tell us very little at all, while others might even conclude that the figures are remarkably low. Eric UNK for example, once said that America was a UNK the only one in the history of the world- for UNK and small children. What matters is that while Fromm's reading of the data is not the only one possible, it is precisely the one we would expect from a writer who earnestly believes that every man can and ought to be happy and satisfied. Fromm also cites a poll on attitudes toward work restriction conducted by the UNK Research Corporation in 1945, in which 49 per cent of manual workers said a man ought to turn out as much as he could in a day's work, while 41 per cent said he should not do his best but should turn out only the average UNK Fromm says these data show that job dissatisfaction and resentment are widespread. That is one way to read the findings, but again there are other ways. One might use such findings to indicate the strength of informal primary associations in the UNK an interpretation which would run counter to Fromm's theory of alienation. Or, he might remind Fromm that the 41 per cent figure is really astonishingly UNK after all, the medieval UNK system was dedicated to the proposition that 100 per cent of the workers ought to turn out only the average UNK and today's trade unions announce pretty much the same view. In view of these shortcomings in both the amount and the interpretation of UNK findings on public opinion, and considering the criticisms which can be brought against Fromm's philosophical UNK such a passage as the following cannot be taken seriously. "Are people happy, are they as satisfied, unconsciously, as they believe themselves to be? Considering the nature of man, and the conditions for happiness, this can hardly be so". The ambiguities suggested above stem from a more basic difficulty in Fromm's style of thought. He seems to use the term alienation in two different ways. Sometimes he uses it as a UNK descriptive term, and sometimes as an objective, diagnostic one. That is, sometimes it is used to UNK UNK human UNK and other times it is postulated to UNK UNK anxiety and UNK The failure to keep these two usages distinct presents hazards to the reader. It also permits Fromm to do some dubious things with empirical UNK When alienation is used as an objective and diagnostic category, for example, it becomes clear that Fromm would have to say that awareness of alienation goes far toward UNK it. (He in effect does say this in his discussion of the UNK of the UNK UNK Starting from this, and accepting his estimate of the UNK of modern society, it would follow that the really disturbing evidence of alienation would be that of a UNK survey which reported UNK stated worker satisfaction, rather than UNK stated worker UNK The point is that in a system such as Fromm's which recognizes unconscious UNK and which rests on certain ethical UNK empirical data can be used to support whatever proposition the writer is urging at the moment. Thus, in the example cited above Fromm rests his whole case on the premise that the workers are being deprived unconsciously, UNK of UNK and then supports this with survey data reporting conscious, experienced UNK He has his cake and UNK it UNK if the workers say they are UNK this shows conscious UNK if they say they are satisfied, this shows unconscious alienation. This sort of manipulation is especially troublesome in Fromm's work because, although his system is derived largely from certain philosophic UNK he asserts that it is based on empirical findings drawn both from social science and from his own consulting room. While the UNK UNK label which Fromm claims UNK no light on the validity of his underlying philosophy, it does increase the UNK of his product. The final example of the failure to use available evidence, though evidence of a different kind from that which has so far been considered, comes from Fromm's treatment of some other writers who have dealt with the same UNK In a brief chapter dealing with UNK Other UNK he quotes isolated passages from some writers whose views seem to UNK his own, and finds it "most remarkable that a critical view of twentieth-century society was already held by a number of thinkers living in the nineteenth **h". He finds it equally UNK that their critical diagnosis and UNK should have so much in common among themselves and with the critics of the twentieth UNK There is nothing remarkable about this at all. It is largely a matter of finding passages that suit one's purposes. There is a difference between evidence and UNK and Fromm's citation of the other UNK fits the latter category. UNK at the UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK London, Marx, UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK A& R& UNK UNK UNK and UNK This is a delightfully motley collection. One can make them say the same thing only by not listening to them very carefully and hearing only what one wants to hear. The method of selection Fromm uses achieves exactly that. Furthermore, the list is interesting for its UNK It UNK for example, practically the whole line of great nineteenth century English social critics, nearly all the great writers whose basic position is religious, and all those who are with more or less accuracy called UNK Of course, the list also excludes all writers who are fairly UNK about the modern UNK these, almost by definition, are spokesmen for an alienated UNK It is not hard to find that concurrence of opinion which Fromm finds so remarkable when you ignore all who hold a different opinion. Turning from these problems of the use of evidence, one meets another type of difficulty in Fromm's analysis, which is his loose and ambiguous use of certain important terms. One such instance has already been UNK his use of alienation. The only other one I shall mention here is his use of the term capitalism. For UNK capitalism is the enemy, the root of all evil. It is of course useful to have a sovereign cause in one's social criticism, for it makes diagnosis and UNK much easier than they might otherwise be. If one characteristic distinguishes UNK UNK it is the consistency with which every person on the UNK including the UNK comes alive in the music. Much of this UNK quality results from UNK care in basing his vocal line on natural speech UNK In this he followed a path that led back to the very source of UNK such composers as UNK UNK and UNK with the same goal in mind, had developed styles of UNK UNK attuned to their own languages. Through long experimentation in his songs, Mussorgsky developed a Russian UNK as different from others as the language itself. UNK most of his musical continuity to the orchestra, he lets the speech fall into place as if by coincidence, but controlling the pace and emphasis of the words. The moments of sung melody, in the usual sense, come most often when the character is actually supposed to be singing, as in folk songs and UNK UNK UNK Mussorgsky reserves his vocal melodies for prolonged expressions of UNK Boris' first UNK for example. Even then, the flexibility of the UNK suggests that the word comes first in importance. Aside from Boris himself, one need but examine the secondary roles to place Mussorgsky among the masters of musical UNK Even those who appear in only one or two scenes are full personalities, defined with economical precision. Consider the four monks who figure prominently in the action: UNK UNK Missail and the Jesuit UNK Under no circumstances could we mistake one for the other; each musical setting has an individual touch. Pimen is an old man, weak in UNK his voice rarely rises to a full UNK but firm and clear of mind. His UNK offers contrast to Grigori's youthful UNK A quiet but sturdy theme, somewhat UNK in character, appears whenever the old monk speaks of the history he is recording or of his own past life: @ This theme comes to represent the outer world, the realm of battles and UNK seen from a distance, quite distinct from the quieter spiritual life in the UNK It changes and develops according to the UNK it introduces Pimen when he comes before Boris in the last act. Once he has been identified, however, a new melody is used to accompany his narrative, a bleak motif with barren UNK creating a rather ancient UNK @ An imaginative UNK Pimen takes on the character he UNK as if he were experiencing the old UNK blindness and miraculous UNK Here the composer uses a favorite device of UNK the intensification of the mood through key relationships. The original ~D minor seems to symbolize UNK inescapable in spite of all attempts to move away from it. As the child addresses the UNK in a dream, UNK in the form of the major UNK begins to UNK and at the moment of the miracle we hear a clear and shining ~D UNK UNK and Missail always appear together and often sing together, in a UNK UNK vigorous UNK that distinguishes them from the more subtle and well-educated UNK Their begging song might easily be a folk UNK @ The same could be said for the song to which they make their entrance in the final scene. Apparently their origin is humble, their approach to life direct and UNK Whatever learning they may have had in their order doesn't disturb them now. Missail is the straight man, not very UNK UNK when he does speak. UNK is UNK UNK uninhibited in his pleasures and impatient with anyone who is not the same. A rough UNK figure, heard first in the introduction to the inn scene, characterizes him UNK and UNK whenever he comes into the action: @ The UNK of UNK in which this figure becomes a UNK UNK fills in the picture of undisciplined high spirits. The UNK is UNK and the abrupt key changes have a primitive UNK (We can imagine how they startled audiences of the UNK UNK music begins to UNK as he feels the effects of the wine, but he pulls himself together when the need UNK Both monks respond to the UNK challenge with a few phrases of their begging UNK a clever naturalistic touch is UNK labored reading of the UNK As the knack gradually comes back to him, his rhythm becomes steadier, with the rigid monotony of an unskilled reader. For the only time in the opera, words are <not> set according to their natural UNK to do so would have UNK the dramatic point of the scene. UNK and UNK Rangoni is as far removed from the conventional monk as UNK His music shows a UNK coupled with an UNK quality that suggest somehow a UNK with UNK in UNK UNK His speech shows none of the native accent of the Russian UNK in spite of the Italian name, he sounds French. His personality appears more striking by contrast with UNK who is- perhaps UNK rather superficially UNK UNK first entrance is a musical shock, a sudden open fifth in a key totally unrelated to what has preceded it. The effect is as if he had UNK out of nowhere. He speaks UNK UNK his authority beneath a smooth UNK just as the shifting harmonies that accompany him all but hide the firm pedal point beneath them. He addresses Marina with great UNK calling her UNK at first; it is only after he has involved her emotions in his scheme that he uses her given name, placing himself by implication in the position of a UNK father. UNK this scene is a close parallel to one that UNK was writing at the same time, the scene between UNK and UNK Rangoni and UNK have the same UNK forcing the girl to charm the man she loves into serving her country's UNK and their tactics are much the same. Rangoni begins by describing the sad state of the UNK this brings a reaction of distress from UNK The music becomes UNK as he calls up a vision of her own UNK it is she, he tells her, who can bring the truth to Russia and convert the UNK As if in a UNK she repeats his words- then UNK with a shock, her own UNK This is no assignment for a UNK girl, she assures him. Now Rangoni comes to the point, and we UNK for the first time, a long, downward chromatic scale that will become the characteristic motif of his sinister power. It is a phrase as arresting as a UNK gesture, with a UNK turn of harmony giving an effect of UNK Another theme, UNK UNK appears as he directs her to gain power over UNK by any means, even at the cost of her honor. UNK from a priest, the music sounds as odd as the UNK @ Marina rebels at this suggestion. Her pride is as much at stake as her UNK she is the UNK beauty, the princess who turns away UNK by the dozen. UNK she UNK Rangoni for his evil thoughts and orders him to leave her. At once the Jesuit pulls out all the UNK To music of a UNK darkness, he describes the powers of UNK gaining control of the girl, UNK her soul with pride and destroying her beauty. The combined threat of UNK and ugliness is too much for her, and she falls terrified at his feet. With another sudden change of UNK he is again calm and UNK UNK her to trust and obey him as God's UNK and the chromatic scale UNK in ominous UNK Whatever the source of UNK power, Marina is his captive now; we are reminded of this at the end of the next scene, when his theme cuts through the warmth of the love UNK again throwing a chill over the atmosphere. The most unusual feature of UNK however, is the use of the greatest character of all, the UNK This is the real UNK of the UNK the conflict is not Boris versus UNK or UNK or even the ghost of the murdered child, but Boris versus the Russian people. Mussorgsky makes this quite clear by the extent to which UNK scenes propel the action. Boris' first entrance seems almost a UNK to the UNK of the UNK UNK with its dazzling confusion of UNK We have a brief glimpse of the UNK public personality, the UNK UNK but our real focus is on the excitement of the UNK a UNK contrast with its UNK UNK in the opening scene, its bitter resentment and fury in the final act. One reason for the unique vitality of the chorus is its great variety in expression. It rarely speaks as a unit. Even in its most conventional appearance, the UNK song of praise to UNK there are a few female UNK UNK the princess for her UNK In many UNK for example, the council of UNK each section of the chorus becomes a character group with a particular opinion. Hot arguments arise between UNK and UNK who will sing in harmony only when they agree on an idea. The opening scene shows this method at its most individual. Mussorgsky paints a telling picture of the common people, those who must suffer the effects of their UNK struggle for power without understanding the causes. They are held in control by force, but UNK They will UNK and plead for Boris' leadership in a strangely intense song, its phrases irregularly broken as if UNK for breath, but when the police with their UNK move away, they mock and grumble and fight among themselves. There is a quick change from the UNK song to a UNK tone. UNK UNK asks one group, "what are we shouting UNK And UNK apparently the intellectual leader of the UNK replies that he has no UNK The jokes and arguments grow UNK until the police UNK then the people strike up their song with even more UNK than before, ending it with a UNK of despair. Mussorgsky frequently uses UNK music with considerable dramatic force. In UNK cell the soft prayers of the monks, heard from UNK not only help to set the scene but emphasize the contrast between young Grigori's thoughts and his situation. This is especially striking between UNK quiet UNK and Grigori's UNK UNK against UNK Again, as Boris feels himself nearing death, a procession files into the hall singing a UNK its UNK harmonies adding a UNK touch to the grim UNK @ The words are hardly calculated to put the UNK mind at ease. They echo the words with which he has described his own vision of the dying child who UNK and UNK for UNK and there is no UNK The living as well as the dead now accuse him; this final reminder of his guilt is the fatal one. One of the outstanding assets of the present production is the restoration of the St& UNK scene, usually omitted from performances and rarely included in a published score. Though brief, it has a sharp dramatic edge and great UNK In addition, it is an important link in the plot, giving us a revealing glimpse of the people's attitude toward Boris and the false UNK The UNK in the forest of UNK is a natural UNK The St& UNK scene opens with little groups of UNK milling around the square, the ever present police keeping them under scrutiny. In the orchestra we hear first a UNK hesitant UNK figure, then the insistent UNK motif as it appeared in the opening scene. The service is over, and a number of people come from the church with their spokesman Mityukh in the lead. They bring the news that the UNK has been UNK this is met with UNK by the UNK who claim that Mityukh is lying or UNK UNK cleverly contrasts the two groups by their orchestral UNK solemn chords or UNK UNK There is still more news, Mityukh UNK they have prayed for the soul of the UNK UNK UNK UNK remarks, like most criticisms of Hardy, have UNK assumed that his poetry is all of a piece, one solid mass of verse expressing a sensibility at a single stage of development. For critics, Hardy has had no poetic UNK one does not speak of early Hardy or late Hardy, or of the London or Max Gate period, but simply of Hardy, as of a poetic UNK This seems odd when one recalls that he wrote poetry longer than any other major English UNK UNK is dated UNK UNK and UNK UNK the Moon UNK is dated August, 1927. One might expect that in a poetic career of UNK years, some changes in style and method would have occurred, some development taken place. This is not, however, the case, and development is a term which we can apply to Hardy only in a very limited sense. In a time when poetic style, and poetic belief as well, seem in a state of continual UNK Hardy stands out as a poet of almost perverse consistency. Though he struggled with philosophy all his life, he never got much beyond the pessimism of his UNK the UNK UNK of his letter to UNK written when Hardy was eighty years old, is essentially that of his first UNK UNK UNK made when he was UNK "The world does not despise UNK it only UNK UNK (<Early Life,> p& UNK And though in his later years he revised his poems many times, the revisions did not alter the essential nature of the style which he had established before he was UNK so that, while it usually is easy to recognize a poem by Hardy, it is difficult to date one. There is only one sense in which it is valid to talk about Hardy's UNK he did develop toward a more consistent and more effective control of that tone which we recognize as uniquely his. There is only one Hardy style, but in the earlier poems that style is only UNK evident, and when it is not, the style is the style of another poet, or of the fashion of the time. In the later poems, however, the personal tone UNK The bad early poems are bad Shakespeare or bad UNK the bad late poems are bad UNK There are two ways of getting at a poet's UNK through his dated poems, and through the revisions which he made in later editions of his work. About a quarter of Hardy's poems carry an UNK date line, usually the year of completion, but sometimes inclusive years UNK or two separate dates when Hardy worked on the poem UNK and UNK or an approximate date UNK the UNK These dates are virtually the only clues we have to the chronology of the poems, since the separate volumes are neither chronological within themselves nor in relation to each other. With the exception of <Satires of UNK each volume contains dated poems ranging over several decades UNK UNK spans sixty-one UNK the internal organization rarely has any chronological order, except in obvious groups like the "Poems of UNK the "Poems of UNK and the war poems. From the dated poems we can venture certain conclusions about Hardy's career in poetry, always remembering that conclusions based on a fraction of the whole must remain UNK The dated poems suggest that while Hardy's concern with poetry may have been constant, his production was not. He had two productive periods, one in the late UNK the other in the decade from 1910 to 1920 UNK of the dated poems are from the latter period, and these alone total about one-tenth of all Hardy's UNK There was one sterile UNK only one poem is dated between UNK and UNK and, except for the poems written on the trip to Italy in UNK very few from UNK to UNK The dated poems also give us an idea of the degree to which Hardy drew upon past productions for his various volumes, and therefore probably are an indication of the amount of poetry he was writing at the time. UNK of the UNK and the UNK and UNK UNK both published while Hardy was at work on <The UNK draw heavily on poems written before 1900. <Satires of UNK and UNK of UNK coming during his most productive decade, are relatively UNK the former contains no poem dated before UNK that is, no poem from a period covered by a previous UNK and the latter has only a few such. The last three volumes are again more dependent on the past, as Hardy's creative powers declined in his old age. These observations about Hardy's productivity tally with the details of his life as we know them. The first productive period came when he was considering poetry as a UNK before he had decided to write fiction for a living (in his note for UNK UNK he wrote that he UNK verses UNK gave up verse for UNK UNK but resumed it UNK During the UNK sterile years he was writing novels at the rate of almost one a year and was, in addition, burdened with bad health (he spent six months in bed in UNK too ill to do more than work slowly and painfully at <A UNK Two entries in the UNK UNK support the assumption that during this period Hardy had virtually suspended the writing of poetry. Mrs& Hardy records that "**h at the end of November UNK he makes a note of an intention to resume poetry as soon as UNK (<Early Life,> p& UNK and on Christmas Day, UNK Hardy wrote: UNK thinking of resuming 'the UNK wings of UNK before dawn this morning, new UNK seemed to open, and UNK UNK to UNK (<Early Life,> p& UNK There are more poems dated in the UNK than in the UNK Hardy had apparently resumed the UNK wings as he decreased the volume of his UNK but none in UNK the year of UNK and only one in UNK the year of UNK After UNK the number increases, and in the next thirty years there is only one year for which there is no dated UNK UNK when Hardy was at work on <The UNK The second productive period, the decade from 1910 to 1920, can be related to three UNK the completion of <The UNK in UNK which left Hardy free of pressure for the first time in forty years; the death of UNK Hardy in 1912, which had a profound emotional effect on Hardy for which he found release in UNK and the First World War. It may seem strange that a poet should come to full UNK in his UNK but we have it on Hardy's own authority that "**h he was a child till he was sixteen, a youth till he was UNK and a young man till he was nearly UNK (<Early Life,> p& UNK We may carry this sequence one step further and say that at seventy he was a poet at the height of his powers, wanting only the impetus of two UNK one personal, the other national, to loose those powers in poetry. Hardy's two productive decades were separated by forty years, yet between them he developed only in that he became more steadily UNK it was a UNK not an expanding process. Like a wise UNK Hardy UNK away the UNK UNK and songs, and the elements of meter and poetic diction to which his personal style was not UNK and let the main stock of his talent flourish. The range of the later poetry is considerably UNK but the number of successful poems is far greater. We can see the general characteristics of the earlier decade if we look at two poems of very different UNK UNK UNK and "Neutral Tones" UNK There is not much to be said for UNK Like about half of the UNK poems, it is a sonnet on a conventional theme- the UNK of love. Almost anyone could have written it; it is competent in the sense that it makes a coherent statement without violating the rules of the sonnet form, but it is entirely UNK and entirely unlike UNK The language is the conventional language of the form; there is no phrase or image that sounds like Hardy or that is striking enough to give individuality to the poem. It is smoother than Hardy usually is, but with the UNK of UNK It is obviously a young man's poem, written out of books and not out of experience; it asserts emotion without UNK it- that is to say, it is UNK There are many such competently anonymous performances among the earlier poems. "Neutral Tones" we immediately recognize as a fine poem in Hardy's most characteristic style: the plain but not quite UNK language, the hard, particular, UNK images, the slightly odd UNK the dramatic handling of the occasion, the refusal to resolve the UNK all these we have seen in Hardy's best poems. The poem does not distort the syntax of ordinary speech nor draw on exotic sources of UNK yet it is obviously <not> ordinary UNK only Hardy would say "a grin of bitterness swept UNK an ominous bird UNK or UNK with wrong", or would describe a winter sun as UNK The details of the setting of "Neutral Tones" are not, strictly speaking, UNK but they combine to create a mood which is appropriate both to a dismal winter day and to the end of love, and in this way love and weather, the emotions and the elements, symbolize each other in a way that is common to many of Hardy's best poems UNK "The UNK UNK and UNK UNK and UNK for UNK and to some moving passages in the novels as well UNK From the UNK UNK is full of scenes constructed in this UNK "Neutral Tones" is an excellent example of Hardy's mature style, drawn from his earliest productive UNK I cite it as evidence that he did not develop through new styles as he grew older (as UNK UNK but that he simply learned to use better what he already had. In the poem we recognize and acknowledge one man's sense of the world; if it is UNK it is also precise, and the precision lends authority to the vision. In UNK on the other hand, the pessimism is a case not UNK the poem offers nothing to persuade us of the UNK right to speak as he does. In the UNK decade there are many poems like UNK but there is only one "Neutral UNK Hardy was not Hardy very often. The "Poems of UNK offer a good example of Hardy's style as it was manifested in the later productive decade. These are the poems Hardy wrote after the death of his first UNK they UNK a painful UNK to what might have been, to a marriage that began with a promise of happiness, and ended in long years of suffering and hatred. Hardy obviously felt that these poems were peculiarly personal and UNK he sometimes called them "an UNK and he would not allow them to be published in periodicals. They are the only poems that he UNK as a group between their first appearance (in <Satires of UNK and the publication of the UNK UNK The UNK tone is Hardy's natural tone of voice, and it is not surprising that the UNK poems are consistently and unmistakably his. The view is always toward the past; but the mood is not quite UNK Hardy would not allow sentiment to soften his sense of the UNK UNK of the past, and the eternal UNK of the dead. The poems are, the UNK tells us, the UNK of an ancient UNK the fire of love is dead, and Hardy stands, as the speaker does in the last poem of the sequence, over the burnt circle of UNK sticks, and thinks of past happiness and present UNK honest and UNK UNK UNK modern UNK like UNK and UNK is perceived only by its effects at more UNK social levels, where it is called UNK UNK by the way, is the term used by the critic and poet, Lawrence Lipton, who has written several articles on this subject, the first of which, in the UNK quoted as UNK "We UNK UNK John L& UNK Like the pillars of UNK like two ruined UNK guarding the entrance to one of UNK circles, stand two great dead juvenile UNK the heroes of the post-war UNK the great UNK Charlie Parker, and Dylan Thomas. If the word deliberate means anything, both of them certainly deliberately destroyed themselves. Both of them were overcome by the horror of the world in which they found themselves, because at last they could no longer overcome that world with the weapon of a purely lyrical art. Both of them were my friends. Living in San Francisco I saw them seldom enough to see them with a perspective which was not distorted by UNK or UNK So as the years passed, I saw them each time in the light of an accelerated personal UNK The last time I saw UNK at UNK Bob City, he was so UNK so blind to the world- that he literally sat down on me before he realized I was there. "What happened, UNK I said, referring to the pretentious UNK UNK UNK man, UNK he said, and that's all he said for the rest of the night. About dawn he got up to UNK The rowdy crowd chilled into stillness and the fluent melody UNK through it. The last time I saw UNK his UNK had not just passed the limits of UNK It had assumed the UNK UNK of UNK matter. Being with him was like being swept away by a torrent of falling UNK Now Dylan Thomas and Charlie Parker have a great deal more in common than the same disastrous end. As artists, they were very similar. They were both very UNK But this UNK enchanting utterance had, compared with important artists of the past, relatively little content. Neither of them got very far beyond a sort of entranced UNK at his own creativity. The principal theme of Thomas's poetry was the ambivalence of birth and UNK the pain of UNK creation. UNK of course, is not so explicit an art, but anybody who knew Charlie Parker knows that he felt much the same way about his own UNK Both of them did communicate one central UNK Against the ruin of the world, there is only one UNK the creative act. This, of course, is the theme of much art- perhaps most poetry. It is the theme of UNK who certainly otherwise bears little resemblance to Parker or Thomas. The difference is that UNK accepted his theme with a kind of UNK UNK To Dylan and Bird it was an UNK and terror. I do not believe that this is due to anything especially frightful about their relationship to their own creativity. I believe rather that it is due to the catastrophic world in which that creativity seemed to be the sole value. UNK column of UNK verse shines quietly enough in the UNK air of UNK Rome. Art may have been for him the most UNK UNK and noble activity of man. But the other activities of his life UNK of these values. They did not actively UNK them. Dylan Thomas's verse had to find endurance in a world of burning cities and burning Jews. He was able to find meaning in his art as long as it was the answer to air raids and gas UNK As the world began to take on the guise of an immense air raid or gas UNK I believe his art became meaningless to him. I think all this could apply to Parker just as well, UNK because of the nature of music, it is not UNK at least not UNK Thomas and Parker have more in common than theme, attitude, life pattern. In the practice of their art, there is an obvious technical UNK Contrary to popular belief, they were not great technical UNK Their effects are only superficially UNK Thomas is a regression from the technical originality and ingenuity of writers like Pierre UNK or UNK Similarly, the innovations of UNK and of Parker particularly, have been vastly UNK by people unfamiliar with music, especially by that UNK the intellectual UNK the jazz UNK The tonal novelties consist in the introduction of a few chords used in classical music for centuries. And there is less rhythmic difference between progressive jazz, no matter how UNK and UNK than there is between two movements of many conventional UNK What Parker and his UNK UNK Davis, UNK UNK UNK is an UNK UNK did was to absorb the musical UNK of the older jazz into the basic structure, of which it then became an integral part, and with which it then developed. This is true of the melodic line which could be put together from selected passages of almost UNK UNK UNK Johnny Hodges. It is true of the rhythmic pattern in which the beat shifts UNK or at least is continuously UNK so that it becomes ambiguous enough to allow the pattern to be dominated by the long UNK of the phrase or UNK This is exactly what happened in the transition from baroque to rococo music. It is the difference between UNK and UNK It is not a UNK analogy to say that this is what Thomas did to poetry. The special UNK effects of a UNK or an Edith UNK actually UNK become the main concern. The metaphysical UNK which UNK the Reactionary UNK still dominant in UNK American colleges, were UNK Thomas's UNK and ambiguities are ends in themselves. The immediate theme, if it exists, is UNK and his main theme- the terror of UNK is simply UNK This is one difference between Bird and Dylan which should be pointed out. Again, contrary to popular belief, there is nothing crazy or frantic about Parker either UNK or UNK His UNK melody is a sort of nai^ve UNK of all experience. UNK it does not resemble UNK or UNK it resembles UNK This is true also of a painter like Jackson UNK He may have been eccentric in his behavior, but his paintings are as UNK as Persian UNK UNK this difference is due to the nature of verbal communication. The insistent UNK of the general environment UNK into even the most idyllic poetry. It is much more a personal difference. Thomas certainly wanted to tell people about the ruin and disorder of the world. Parker and UNK wanted to substitute a work of art for the world. UNK pure and simple, UNK is not of major importance, but it is interesting that Parker, following Lester Young, was one of the leaders of the so-called saxophone revolution. In modern jazz, the saxophone is treated as a UNK and played with conventional UNK UNK Thomas's verse was extremely UNK as was, UNK the verse of that other tragic UNK Hart UNK I want to make clear what I consider the one technical development in the first wave of significant post-war arts. UNK is UNK in the UNK of structure. A poem by Dylan Thomas, a saxophone solo by Charles Parker, a painting by Jackson UNK these are pure UNK as ends in themselves. UNK has come to determine structure. UNK UNK should be distinguished from its exact UNK the UNK extraneous invention of the UNK UNK or present UNK of poetic UNK Just as Hart UNK had little influence on anyone except very reactionary UNK like Allen UNK for instance, to whom UNK was the last word in modern poetry and the UNK of an UNK let alone a Paul UNK were UNK so Dylan Thomas's influence has been slight indeed. In fact, his only UNK the only person to imitate his style- was W& S& Graham, who seems to have UNK him without much understanding, and who has since moved on to other methods. Thomas's principal influence lay in the communication of an UNK that of the now UNK British romantic school of the New UNK Henry UNK J& F& UNK and others- all of whom were quite conventional UNK Parker certainly had much more of an influence. At one time it was the ambition of every saxophone player in every high school band in America to blow like UNK Even before his death this influence had begun to UNK In fact, the whole generation of the founding fathers of UNK UNK UNK Davis, UNK and the rest- are just now at a considerable UNK The main line of development today goes back to Lester Young and UNK them. The point is that many of the most impressive developments in the arts nowadays are UNK UNK There is no longer any sense of continuing development of the sort that can be traced from UNK to UNK or for that matter, from Hawthorne through Henry James to UNK UNK The UNK generation before World War /1,, and, on a lower level, the UNK of the period between the wars, both assumed an accepted universe of discourse, in which, to quote Andre UNK it was possible to make definite advances, exactly as in the sciences. I doubt if anyone holds such ideas today. UNK UNK but like the UNK music developed from Lester Young, it is a continuity sustained by popular demand. In the plastic arts, a very similar situation exists. UNK like Hans Arp and Max Ernst might talk of creation by UNK of composing pictures by walking on them with painted UNK or by UNK bits of paper up in the air. But it is obvious that they were UNK Nothing looks anything like an Ernst or an Arp but another Ernst or UNK Nothing looks less like their work than the happenings of random occasion. Many of the post-World War /2, abstract UNK UNK of the discipline of spontaneity and UNK look alike, and do look like UNK The aesthetic appeal of pure paint laid on at random may exist, but it is a very impoverished UNK Once again what has happened is an UNK UNK of the UNK the accidents of painting. It is curious that at its best, the work of this school of UNK Mark UNK Jackson UNK UNK Still, Robert UNK UNK UNK and the rest- resembles nothing so much as the passage painting of quite UNK UNK the UNK UNK in the background of a Henry UNK itself a formula derived from UNK the UNK of light and black which fake UNK in the fashionable UNK of UNK and UNK Often work of this sort is presented as UNK the pure utterance of the brush stroke seeking only absolute UNK values. You have only to compare such painting with the work of, say, UNK to realize that someone is using words and UNK UNK At its best the abstract UNK achieve a simple rococo decorative surface. Its poverty shows up immediately when compared with UNK where the rococo rises to painting of extraordinary UNK and power. A UNK painting, however UNK is a universe of tensions in vast depths. A UNK is an object of art- UNK disguised only by its great size. In fact, once the size is big enough to cover a whole wall, it turns into nothing more than extremely expensive UNK Now there is nothing wrong with complicated UNK There is just more to UNK The great UNK brush painters painted UNK too- at least portable ones, UNK A process of elimination which leaves the artist with nothing but the play of his materials themselves cannot sustain interest in either artist or public for very long. So, in the last couple of years, abstract UNK has tended toward romantic UNK indications of landscape or living figures. UNK and Greek epic each provide on two occasions a seemingly authentic account of the UNK of verse in the heroic age. UNK court UNK sings of the encounters at UNK UNK UNK and UNK the tale of UNK exploits in a UNK comparison of the UNK visitor with UNK UNK UNK UNK court UNK sings of the discovered UNK of UNK and UNK UNK UNK and takes up a tale of UNK while the UNK UNK UNK on UNK UNK Nothing in all this is UNK unlike the poets of UNK and UNK the poet of <Beowulf> is not concerned with his own UNK the poet of the UNK reputed blind, reveals himself not at all in singing of the blind UNK UNK Since none of these glimpses of UNK without writing is intended to UNK a UNK into the epic matter, there is UNK evidence that <Beowulf> and the Homeric poems each derive from an oral tradition. That such a tradition lies behind the <Iliad> and the UNK at least, is hard to UNK UNK UNK rigorously defended the observation that the extant Homeric poems are largely formulaic, and was led to postulate that they could be shown entirely formulaic if the complete corpus of Greek epic UNK he further UNK that frequent formulas in epic verse indicate oral composition, and assumed the slightly less likely UNK that oral epic is inclined towards the use of formulas. Proceeding from UNK conclusions and adopting one of his UNK Francis P& UNK Jr&, argues that <Beowulf> likewise was created from a legacy of oral formulas inherited and extended by UNK of successive generations, and the thesis is striking and UNK Yet a fresh inspection will indicate one crucial UNK <Beowulf> and the Homeric poems are not at all formulaic to the same extent. The UNK UNK by an oral poet is to be estimated only by a very UNK oral poet, but it appears safe to assume that no sustained narrative in UNK could be composed without extreme difficulty, even in a language of many terminal UNK UNK seems nearly as severe a UNK although in a celebrated passage William of UNK declares that a UNK of UNK was UNK before the battle commenced at UNK The Anglo-Saxon UNK line and the Homeric UNK probably imposed less of a UNK the verse of <Beowulf> or of the <Iliad> and the <Odyssey> was not easy to create but was not impossible for poets who had developed their talents UNK in earning a UNK Yet certain aids were valuable and quite UNK necessary for UNK long stretches of verse without a pause. The poet in a written tradition who generally never blots a line may once in a while pause and polish without UNK blame. But the oral poet cannot UNK he must UNK continuously with no apparent effort. Even though the UNK of his verse is not so great as the writing poet can UNK it is still great enough for him often to be seriously impeded unless he has aids to facilitate rapid composition. The Germanic poet had such aids in the UNK which provided for the difficulties of UNK the Homeric poet had UNK which provided for recurring needs in the UNK Either poet could quickly and easily select words or phrases to supply his immediate requirements as he chanted out his lines, because the kennings and the epithets made possible the construction of systems of numerous UNK for the chief common and proper UNK Other UNK could of course serve the same function, and for the sake of ease I shall speak of kennings and epithets in the widest and UNK UNK sense, and name, for example, UNK a UNK for the UNK UNK and UNK elements too participated in each epic UNK but it is for the present sufficient to mark the large nominal and adjectival supply of semantic UNK and to designate the members of any system of equivalents as basic formulas of the poetic language. UNK to a few thousand lines of heroic verse in Anglo-Saxon as in the other Germanic UNK we cannot say how frequently the kennings in <Beowulf> recurred in contemporary epic on the same soil. But we can say that since a writing poet, with leisure before him, would seem unlikely to invent a technique based upon frequent and substantial UNK the kennings like the epithets must reasonably be ascribed to an oral tradition. One of the greatest UNK of our time, Frederick M& UNK argues that when it is assumed the <Iliad> and the <Odyssey> are oral poems, the postulated single UNK called Homer cannot be either credited with or denied originality in choice of UNK Any example of grand or UNK diction may have been created by the poet who compiled numerous lays into the two works we possess or may be due to one of his completely unknown UNK The quest of the historical Homer is likely never to have further UNK no individual word in the <Iliad> or the <Odyssey> can be credited to any one man; no strikingly effective element of speech in the extant poems can with assurance be said not to have been a commonplace in the UNK epic corpus that may have existed at the beginning of the first UNK before Christ. This observation is of interest not only to students of Homeric poetry but to students of Anglo-Saxon poetry as well. To the extent that a tale is twice told, its final author must be suspect, although UNK in an oral tradition is less a UNK than the standard UNK UNK UNK argues further, and here he makes his main point, that once the <Iliad> and the <Odyssey> are thought formulaic poems composed for an audience accustomed to formulaic poetry, Homeric critics are deprived of an entire domain they previously found UNK With a few important and a few more unimportant exceptions, no expression can be deemed UNK UNK UNK for its context, because each was very probably the only expression that UNK practice and ease of rapid recitation would UNK UNK or phrases that UNK have admired as handsome or ironic or humorous must therefore lose merit and become regarded as mere inevitable UNK sometimes accurate and sometimes not. This observation too may have reference to Anglo-Saxon poetry. To the extent that a language is formulaic, its individual components must be regarded as no more distinguished than other UNK W& F& Bryan suggests that certain kennings in <Beowulf> were selected sometimes for UNK and sometimes for ironic UNK but such a view would appear UNK unless it is denied that the language of <Beowulf> is UNK If the master of UNK who was most responsible for the poem ever used kennings that were UNK he was at least partly deprived of free will and not inclined towards shrewd and sophisticated misuse of speech elements. Once many significant phrases are found in theory or in recurrent practice to provide for prosodic necessity, they are not to be defended for their semantic properties in isolated UNK It is false to be certain of having discovered in the language of <Beowulf> such effects as intentional UNK Yet, if the argument is turned UNK there may be found a great deal in UNK view, after all. A formulaic element need not be held meaningless merely because it was selected with little conscious reflection. UNK though the UNK expressions are, they may nevertheless be handsome or ironic or UNK A long evolution in an oral tradition caused the poetic language of the heroic age to be based upon formulas that show the important qualities of things, and these formulas are therefore potentially rather than always actually UNK True, we do not know how they were regarded in their day, but we need not believe the epic audience to have been more insensitive to the formulas than the numerous scholars of modern times who have read Germanic or Homeric poetry all their lives and still found much to admire in occasional occurrences of the most familiar UNK UNK and UNK in a written tradition are chosen for the UNK in an oral tradition they may be chosen for the entire epic UNK and tend towards UNK rather than distinctive UNK UNK is therefore not to be placed upon the archaeological particulars in an oral UNK UNK today would hope to discover the unmistakable ruins of UNK or the palace of UNK A ship at UNK could be called a UNK UNK in Anglo-Saxon or a swift ship in Greek. Even when UNK of weapons the UNK would be UNK (as their king is UNK and UNK would be UNK UNK like UNK in the UNK is potentially the UNK of men and may accordingly be called UNK even when he stands UNK In UNK the UNK of UNK is used deliberately and UNK but the Homeric epithets and the Anglo-Saxon kennings are used casually and recall to the UNK "a familiar story or situation or a useful or pleasant quality of the UNK The epic language was not entirely the servant of the UNK it was partly his master. The poet's intentions are difficult to discern and, except to UNK UNK the language, however, is a proper object of UNK and the effects of the language are UNK even if sometimes inevitable. <Beowulf> and the Homeric poems appear oral UNK Yet they are UNK at some stage in their evolution they were UNK Albert B& Lord suggests that the Homeric poems were dictated to a UNK by a UNK who held in his mind the poems fully UNK but did not himself possess the knowledge of writing since it would be useless to his UNK and UNK argues that the <Beowulf> poet and UNK may have dictated their verse in the same fashion. This explanation is attractive, but is UNK at least in part by the observation that UNK though he used kennings in the traditional manner, was a UNK man who four times inscribed his name by UNK into his works. If UNK was UNK the <Beowulf> poet may have been also, and so may the final UNK of the <Iliad> and the UNK In lieu of the UNK to the blind or illiterate UNK one may conceive of a man who heard a vast store of oral poetry UNK and became intimately familiar with the established aids to UNK and himself wrote his own compositions or his edition of the compositions of the past. Other theories of origin are compatible with the formulaic UNK <Beowulf> may contain a design for terror, and the <Iliad> may have a vast UNK pattern answering to a ceramic pattern produced during the Geometric UNK in pottery. The account of the growth and final UNK of these UNK rests UNK however, upon the degree to which they were UNK Carl UNK UNK counted UNK different lines repeated exactly in the two Homeric poems, and by increasing this figure so as to include lines repeated with very slight modifications he counted UNK different lines used a total of UNK times. Thus one line in five from the <Iliad> and the <Odyssey> is to be found somewhere else in the two poems. The ratio is thoroughly UNK because the lines are so long- half again as long as those of UNK Anglo-Saxon poetry appears to have no comparable amount of UNK there is no reason to think that the UNK used and UNK whole lines and even lengthy passages after the manner of his Homeric UNK In determining the extent to which any poem is formulaic it is UNK however, to inspect nothing besides lines repeated in their UNK for a stock of UNK would be sufficient to permit the poet to UNK with UNK if they provided for prosodic needs. The closest scrutiny is owed to the Anglo-Saxon kennings and the Homeric UNK if any words or phrases are formulaic, they will be. The <Iliad> has two words for the UNK UNK and UNK UNK UNK OF <Great Expectations> has tended to emphasize its symbolic and UNK content, to show, as M& D& UNK has said of Dickens generally, that much of the UNK impact resides in its UNK insight and moral UNK J& H& Miller's excellent chapter on <Great Expectations> has lately illustrated how UNK that novel can be read from such a perspective. In his analysis, however, he touches upon but fails to explore an idea, generally neglected in discussions of the book, which I believe is central to its art- the importance of human hands as a recurring feature of the narrative. This essay seeks to make that exploration. Dickens was not for nothing the most theatrical of the great Victorian writers. He knew instinctively that next to voice and face an UNK hands are his most useful UNK that in fiction as in the UNK gesture is an indispensable UNK for UNK character and UNK action and response. It is hardly UNK therefore, that many of his most vivid figures do suggestive or eccentric things with their hands. In <Great Expectations> the hands become almost an UNK Mr& UNK UNK bites his UNK a gesture which conveys both contempt and the inscrutable UNK that half UNK half UNK all who have dealings with him. Miss UNK UNK hands, heavy as if her UNK were somehow concentrated in them, move in restless UNK between her broken heart and her walking UNK UNK UNK is the perpetually extended glad hand. UNK reveals his UNK by regularly rubbing his hands together. Old Mr& UNK frantic response to life imprisonment with a UNK UNK wife is to "put his two hands into his disturbed UNK and UNK an extraordinary effort to lift himself up by it", UNK whereas Joe UNK UNK the UNK UNK of Mrs& Joe by UNK drawing "the back of his hand across and across his UNK (7) Such UNK would be less worthy of UNK were it not that in <Great UNK as in no other of UNK novels, hands serve as a UNK of plot and theme- a kind of unifying symbol or natural UNK for the book's complex of human UNK and the values and attitudes that UNK them. Dickens not only reveals character through gesture, he makes hands a crucial element of the plot, a means of clarifying the structure of the novel by helping to define the UNK relations with all the major characters, and a device for ordering such diverse themes as guilt, UNK crime, UNK education, UNK UNK (by both people and UNK friendship, romantic love, forgiveness, and UNK We have only to think of Lady Macbeth or the UNK in Thomas UNK famous story, "The UNK of Mr& UNK to realize that hands often call up ideas of crime and punishment. So it is with <Great UNK whether the hands be Orlick's as he strikes down Mrs& UNK or Pip's as he UNK a pie from her UNK Such associations suit well with the UNK or UNK aspects of UNK novel, but, on a deeper plane, they relate to the themes of sin, guilt, and pursuit that have recently been analyzed by other critics. The novel opens with a UNK convict UNK trying to avoid the UNK of being UNK hands UNK (3) a mysterious figure who looks into Pip's frightened eyes in the churchyard "as if he were UNK the hands of the dead people, stretching up cautiously out of their UNK to get a twist upon his UNK and pull him in". (1) UNK UNK Pip into stealing a pork pie for him by creating the image in the boy's imagination of a UNK man who may UNK creep **h his way to him and tear him UNK (1) UNK his hands" (2) in him. As Pip UNK over the theft that his own hands have UNK his guilty conscience projects itself upon the wooden finger of a local UNK UNK it into "a UNK devoting me to the UNK (3) Held upside down in the UNK Pip clings in terror "with both hands" (1) to his UNK later he UNK in panic from the family table just as his theft is about to be discovered and is blocked at the front door by a soldier who UNK holds out a pair of UNK which he has brought to UNK UNK for UNK Through such details Dickens indicates at the outset that guilt is a part of the ironic bond between Pip and UNK which is so UNK to alter both their lives. Since they commonly translate thoughts and feelings into UNK hands naturally represent action, and since nearly half the characters in <Great Expectations> are of the underworld or closely allied to it, the linking of hands with crime or violence is not to be wondered at. Dickens, for excellent psychological reasons, never fully reveals Magwitch's UNK past, but UNK at the UNK climactic UNK in London, UNK from UNK a hand which he fears UNK be stained with UNK UNK Orlick UNK about the UNK "like UNK with UNK hands in his UNK (15) and when he UNK abuse at Mrs& Joe for UNK to his holiday, she UNK her hands in a UNK beats them UNK her UNK and upon her UNK (15) and UNK them in her husband's hair. This last UNK is only the UNK to the vicious blow upon her head, UNK by some unknown hand" (15) whose identity is later revealed not verbally but through a manual UNK the tracing of Orlick's UNK upon a UNK Pip himself is to feel the terror of Orlick's UNK hand" UNK in his secret rendezvous at the UNK on the UNK Dickens lays great emphasis on the hands in this scene. Orlick shakes his hand at UNK UNK the table with his UNK draws his UNK hand UNK his mouth as if his mouth UNK for his victim, lets his hands hang "loose and heavy at his UNK and Pip observes him so intensely that he knows "of the slightest action of his UNK UNK Orlick might almost be Magwitch's UNK man come alive, a figure of UNK from Pip's UNK of UNK The UNK disfigured UNK of Mr& UNK UNK are the UNK marks of her sinister past, for her master, UNK exhibiting them to his dinner guests, makes a point of the UNK of grip there is in these hands".

Finally, Magwitch's pursuit of UNK his UNK and UNK begins by his holding him in a UNK grip on the river UNK to frustrate his escape and culminates in his UNK his hand on his UNK to identify him", UNK thus UNK the UNK struggle in the water during which UNK UNK Magwitch's hand here UNK becomes the agent of justice. But only in one of its aspects is <Great Expectations> a tale of violence, UNK and UNK UNK so important a theme elsewhere in Dickens, is here UNK and hands are often associated in some way with the false values- UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK that attach to a society based upon the pursuit of wealth. Dickens suggests the economic evils of such a society on the first page of his novel in the description of Pip's five little dead brothers "who gave up trying to get a living exceedingly early in that universal UNK who seemed to have "all been born on their backs with their hands in their UNK and had never taken them out in this state of UNK (1) Pip's great expectations, his progress through illusion and UNK turn, somewhat as they do for the UNK hero of UNK <American UNK upon the lure of genteel prosperity through UNK UNK what UNK calls UNK property" and what UNK UNK Pip for letting UNK through UNK UNK UNK Since a gentleman must, if possible, avoid UNK them by work, his hands, as importantly as his accent, become the index of social status.

During the assignment pass of Phase /3,, index words and electronic switches are reserved as they are encountered during assignment. Index words and electronic switches may be reserved in the following ways. The first two methods apply to both index words and electronic UNK the third applies only to index words. _1._ During the assignment pass, each instruction is examined for reference to the symbolic name of an index word or electronic UNK When such a reference is found, an actual address is assigned and the availability table is changed so that the assigned index word or switch is no longer available for later assignment. _2._ If the one- or two-digit address of an index word or electronic switch is used or is included in the operand of an UNK or UNK statement (see page UNK the corresponding index word or electronic switch is reserved. _3._ If a statement has been assigned an address in the index word area _A._ by means of an actual label or _B._ by means of an UNK statement which refers to an UNK UNK the corresponding index word will be reserved. These entries should normally appear at the beginning of the program or immediately following each UNK statement. Otherwise, symbolic names may have previously been assigned to these same index words. (This method does not apply to electronic UNK The preceding methods allow efficient use of index words and electronic switches during a UNK or UNK program, particularly when used in conjunction with the UNK statement. UNK caution should be used, however, to avoid the conflicting usage of an index word or electronic switch which may result from the assignment of more than one name or function to the same address. If the symbolic name or actual address of an index word or electronic switch appears or is included in the operand of an UNK or UNK statement (see page UNK the specified index word or electronic switch will again be made available, regardless of the method by which it was reserved. It will not, however, be used for symbolic assignment until all other index words or electronic switches have been assigned for the first time. If, at any time during the assignment pass, the compiler finds that there are no more index words available for assignment, the warning message UNK MORE INDEX UNK UNK will be placed in the object program UNK the table will be altered to show that index words 1 through 96 are available, and the assignment will continue as before. If the compiler finds that there are no more electronic switches available for assignment, the warning message UNK MORE ELECTRONIC UNK UNK will be placed in the object program UNK the table will be altered to show that electronic switches 1 through 30 are available, and assignment will continue as before. The resultant conflicting usage of index words or electronic switches may be avoided by reducing the number of symbolic names used, e&g&, through the proper use of the UNK UNK or UNK statements. As noted in Appendix ~C, index words 97 through 99 are <never> available for assignment to symbolic names by the UNK also, index words UNK through 96 may have been made unavailable for assignment. UNK UNK Autocoder declarative statements provide the UNK with the necessary information to complete the imperative operations properly. UNK statements are never executed in the object program and should be separated from the program instruction area, placed preferably at its beginning or end. Otherwise, special care must be taken to branch around them so that the program will not attempt to execute something in a data area as an instruction. If the compiler does encounter such statements, a warning message will be issued. 7070/7074 Autocoder includes the following declarative UNK ~DA (Define UNK ~DC (Define UNK ~DRDW (Define UNK UNK UNK UNK (Define UNK ~DLINE (Define UNK ~EQU UNK UNK UNK (Define UNK UNK ~DIOCS (Define Input/Output Control UNK and ~DUF UNK UNK for Unit UNK UNK UNK ~DTF, and ~DLINE require more than one entry.

The high cost of land and a few operational problems resulting from excessive loadings have created the need for a UNK treatment system with the operational characteristics of the oxidation pond but with the ability to treat more organic matter per unit volume. Research at UNK Missouri on oxidation ponds has shown that the ~BOD in the treated effluent varied from 30 to 53 ~mg/~l with loadings from 8 to 120 ~lb UNK Since experience indicates that UNK from oxidation ponds do not create major problems at these ~BOD UNK the goal for the effluent quality of the accelerated treatment system was the same as from conventional oxidation UNK Recent studies by Weston and UNK had indicated that a turbine aerator could be added to an oxidation pond to increase the rate of oxygen UNK Their study showed that it was possible to transfer 3 to 4 ~lb of UNK UNK and UNK discussed the use of aerated UNK for treating organic UNK They indicated that a UNK UNK aerated lagoon would give 60 to 76 per cent ~BOD UNK Later, UNK increased the efficiency of treatment to between 75 and 85 per cent in the summer months. It appeared from the limited information available that the aerated lagoon might offer a satisfactory means of increasing the capacity of existing oxidation ponds as well as providing the same degree of treatment in a smaller volume. UNK UNK UNK With the development of the Red Bridge UNK south of Kansas City, Missouri, the developer was faced with the problem of providing adequate sewage UNK The sewage system from Kansas City was not expected to serve the Red Bridge area for several years. This necessitated the construction of temporary sewage treatment facilities with an expected life from 5 to 15 UNK For the initial development an oxidation pond was constructed as shown in Figure 1. The oxidation pond has a surface area of UNK acres and a depth of 4 UNK The pond is currently serving UNK persons or 260 persons per UNK In the summer of 1960 the oxidation pond became completely septic and emitted UNK UNK It was possible to maintain UNK conditions in the pond by regular additions of sodium UNK until the temperature decreased and the algae population changed from UNK to green UNK The UNK conditions in the existing oxidation pond necessitated examination of other methods for supplying additional oxygen than by sodium UNK At the same time further expansion in the Red Bridge UNK required the construction of additional sewage treatment facilities. The large land areas required for oxidation ponds made this type of treatment financially UNK to the UNK It was proposed that aerated UNK be used to eliminate the problem at the existing oxidation ponds and to provide the necessary treatment for the additional development. UNK UNK The lack of adequate data on the aerated lagoon system prompted the developer to construct an aerated lagoon pilot plant to determine its feasibility for treating domestic sewage. The pilot plant was a circular lagoon UNK ~ft in UNK at the surface and 65 ~ft in UNK at the bottom, 4 ~ft below the surface, with a volume of UNK UNK The side slopes were coated with UNK UNK coated with asphalt to prevent UNK The pilot lagoon was located as shown in Figure 1 to serve the area just south of the existing housing area. The major UNK was a shopping center with houses being added to the system as the subdivision developed. The pilot lagoon was designed to handle the wastes from UNK persons with a UNK aeration period. Initially, the UNK would be entirely from the shopping center with the domestic sewage from the houses increasing over an UNK period. This operation would permit evaluation of the pilot plant, with a slowly increasing load, over a reasonable period of time. The pilot plant was equipped with a UNK turbine aerator UNK 2). The aerator had a UNK drive to permit operation through a range of speeds. The sewage flow into the treatment plant was metered and continuously recorded on 24-~hr UNK The raw sewage was introduced directly under the turbine aerator to insure maximum mixing of the raw sewage with the aeration tank UNK The effluent was collected through two pipes and discharged to the Blue River through a surface drainage UNK UNK UNK samples were collected at weekly intervals. The long retention period and the complete mixing concept prevented rapid changes in either the mixed liquor or in the UNK UNK samples would make any changes more readily discernible than daily samples. The composite samples were normally collected over a 6-~hr period, but an occasional 24-~hr composite was made. UNK of the operations of the shopping center permitted correlation of the 6-~hr composite samples with 24-~hr operations. The data indicated that the organic load during the 6-~hr UNK was essentially 50 per cent of the 24-~hr organic load. UNK samples were collected from the existing oxidation pond to determine its operating conditions. UNK were made to take the grab samples at random periods so that the mass of data could be treated as a 6-~hr composite UNK A single 24-~hr composite sample indicated that the sewage flow pattern and characteristics were UNK UNK UNK OPERATIONS# The ~BOD of the UNK to the pilot plant varied between 110 and UNK ~mg/~l with an average of 350 ~mg/~l. This was equivalent to UNK UNK on a 24-~hr basis. The ~BOD of the raw sewage was typical of domestic sewage from a UNK The ~BOD in the effluent averaged UNK ~mg/~l, a UNK cent reduction over the 24-~hr period. UNK of the data in Table /1, shows that a few samples contributed to raising the effluent ~BOD. The periods of high effluent ~BOD occurred during cold periods when operational problems with the aerator UNK UNK caused the aerator to UNK straining the drive UNK The UNK of the drive belts caused the aerator to slow down and reduce oxygen transfer as well as the mixing of the raw sewage. The organic loading on the unit averaged 32 ~lb of UNK or about 2 ~lb UNK UNK ~ft aeration capacity. Needless to say, the organic load was very low on a UNK basis, but was UNK ~lb UNK on a surface loading basis. It seems that the aerated lagoon was a very heavily loaded oxidation pond or a lightly loaded activated sludge system. The flow rate remained relatively constant during the winter months as shown in Table /1,. With the spring UNK the flow rose rapidly due to infiltration in open UNK As construction UNK the volume of storm drainage will be sharply reduced. The retention period in the aerated lagoon ranged from UNK to 2.6 days, averaging UNK days. The large amount of vegetable UNK from the grocery store in the shopping center created a suspended solids problem. The vegetables were not readily UNK by the bacteria in the aeration unit and tended to UNK on the surface. A skimming device at the effluent UNK prevented loss of most of these light UNK The average volatile suspended solids in the effluent was 75 ~mg/~l while UNK averaged UNK ~mg/~l volatile suspended UNK The average sludge age based on displacement of solids was calculated to be UNK days. The oxygen uptake rate in the mixed liquor averaged 0.8 UNK during the first four months of this study. Variations in aerator speeds during the latter two months of this study caused increased mixing and increased oxygen demand. The increase in oxygen uptake rates from UNK to 2.6 UNK which followed an increase in rotor speed was believed to be related to UNK of solids which had settled at the lower rotor speeds. It appeared that most of the mixed liquor suspended solids were active UNK solids with the UNK less active solids settling out. The suspended solids discharged in the effluent were found to be the major source of the ~BOD. UNK of the suspended solids by a membrane filter yielded an average effluent containing only 20 ~mg/~l ~BOD. The ~BOD in the drainage ditch receiving the pilot plant effluent averaged 12 ~mg/~l. This low ~BOD was due to removal of the excess suspended solids by UNK since the only dilution was surface UNK which was very low during this study. UNK UNK UNK microscopic examinations were made of the mixed liquor as indicated by UNK and UNK for the various types of UNK It was found that the aerated lagoon was an activated sludge system rather than an oxidation UNK At no time were algae found in the mixed liquor. The bacteria formed typical activated sludge UNK The UNK particles were all small as the heavier UNK settled out. Initially, the UNK protozoa UNK but they soon gave way to the free swimming ciliated UNK As the temperature UNK the number of free swimming ciliated protozoa decreased. Very little protozoa activity existed below UNK When the temperature reached UNK all UNK activity UNK but as the temperature rose, the numbers of protozoa increased rapidly. Only once were stalked UNK found in the mixed liquor. The UNK of free swimming ciliated protozoa is indicative of a high bacterial population. UNK UNK One of the important aspects of this study was to determine the oxygen transfer relationships of the mechanical UNK UNK UNK were made for dissolved oxygen in the mixed liquor and for oxygen uptake rates. The data given in Table /2, show the routine operation of the UNK The dissolved oxygen in the aeration unit was consistently high until January 29, 1961. An extended cold spell caused ice to build up on the aerator which was mounted on a floating platform and caused the entire platform to sink lower in the water. The added resistance to the rotor damaged the drive belts and reduced the oxygen transfer capacity. It was approximately one month before the belt problem was noticed and UNK but at no time was there a deficiency of dissolved UNK A series of eight special tests were conducted at different rotor speeds to determine the oxygen transfer rate. Five of the tests were conducted with a polyethylene cover to simulate an ice cover. The rate of oxygen transfer at UNK dissolved oxygen concentration and UNK for various rotor speeds is given in Table /3,. The maximum rate of oxygen transfer at 1.0 ~mg/~l dissolved oxygen was calculated as UNK UNK at a maximum rate of UNK UNK The actual power requirements indicated UNK oxygen UNK The polyethylene cover reduced the oxygen transfer rate by 10 per cent, indicating that the maximum oxygen transfer is at the rotor rather than through the surface. UNK UNK During this study septic conditions developed in the oxidation pond in the spring when the ice UNK Shortly after this study ended septic conditions resulted which required the addition of sodium UNK The location of the oxidation pond in a high-value residential area makes odor UNK a sensitive problem for the UNK The organic concentration in the UNK raw sewage ranged from 160 to UNK ~mg/~l of ~BOD with an average of UNK ~mg/~l. The ~BOD data are given in Table /4,. A single 24-~hr composite sample had a ~BOD of 260 ~mg/~l, indicating a typical domestic sewage. The daily sewage volume to the oxidation pond averaged UNK UNK giving a retention period of 42 days. The organic loading on the pond was slightly under UNK The effluent ~BOD averaged 34 ~mg/~l, a little lower than that of the study at Fayette indicated for a loading of UNK UNK The ~BOD of the effluent ranged from a minimum of 13 to a maximum of UNK UNK examination of the effluent showed that minimum ~BOD occurred when the algae began to decrease with cold weather. When the algae began to build up again, the effluent ~BOD rose. During the two weeks when the algae disappeared from the effluent UNK in the effluent were 18 and 16 ~mg/~l. Thus, the three main categories of antisubmarine warfare operations are defense of shipping, defense of naval forces, and area defense. The last category UNK the others in UNK operations and near UNK and bases. To effect these operations, five elements exist (1) surface, (2) air, (3) mines, (4) submarine, and (5) fixed installations. UNK forces have been used to provide defense zones around naval and merchant ship formations, air to furnish area UNK and mines for protection of limited areas. UNK and shore installations are new elements. The submarine now has a definite place in submarine defense particularly in denying enemy access to ocean areas. Fixed installations offer possibilities for area UNK UNK warfare is being UNK against submarine targets. A sixth UNK not always considered, is intelligence. It includes operational intelligence of the enemy and knowledge of the environment. UNK intelligence presumably will be available from our national intelligence UNK intelligence on the environment will come from the recently augmented program in UNK The major postwar development is the certainty that these elements should not be considered singly but in combination and as being mutually UNK UNK FOR AN UNK UNK Thinking on submarine defense has not always been UNK UNK of single elements tend to ensure UNK of that element without determining if it is justified, and the element with the most enthusiastic and vociferous proponents has assumed the greatest importance. Consequently, air, surface, and submarine elements UNK the mine, fixed installations, and intelligence. These have sought more and more of what they have. Each seems to strive for elimination of the necessity for the others. This, despite postwar experience demonstrating that all elements are necessarily mutually UNK Thus, the most productive areas are not necessarily the most stressed. This is stated to emphasize the necessity for an over-all concept of submarine defense, one which would provide positions of relative importance to ~ASW elements based on projected UNK Then the enthusiasm and energy of all elements can be channeled to produce cumulative progress toward a common UNK An over-all concept would have other advantages. It would allow presentation to the public of a unified approach. Now the problem is presented UNK and sometimes UNK While one element is announcing progress, another is UNK its problems. The result can only be confusion in the public mind. A unified concept can serve as a guide to budgeting and, if public support is UNK will command Congressional support. UNK main criticism of the Navy's antisubmarine effort is that it cannot determine where any one company or industry can apply its skills and UNK Lacking guidance, industry UNK its own areas. The result, coupled with the UNK for which American industry is UNK is considerable expenditure of funds and efforts in marginal areas. An over-all concept will guide industry where available talents and facilities will yield greatest UNK Therefore, a broad concept of over-all submarine defense is needed for UNK of the Navy's efforts, for a logical presentation to the public, for industry's guidance, and as a basis for a program to the Congress. UNK UNK IN AN UNK UNK That which follows will be a discussion of principles and possible content for an over-all concept of antisubmarine warfare. Russia possesses the UNK of submarines in the world, divided between her various UNK Some are also in Albania and others are on loan to UNK Other countries which may willingly or UNK become Communist can furnish bases. Communist target areas can be UNK but there is no certainty that such assumptions coincide with Soviet intentions. UNK can come from almost any direction against many UNK UNK then, the first principle of the plan must be that it is not rigidly oriented toward any geographical area. It is often stated that the submarine can be destroyed while building, at UNK in UNK and on station. UNK of the enemy's building and base complex, however, requires attacks on enemy territory, which is possible only in event of all-out UNK In transit or on station, it may not be possible to attack the submarines until commission of an overt act. The Communists are adept at utilizing hostilities short of general war and will do so whenever it is to their advantage. Therefore the second principle of the plan must be that, while providing for all-out UNK its effectiveness is not dependent on general war. UNK warfare does not involve UNK between large opposing forces, with the decision a result of a single battle. It is a war of UNK of single actions, of an exchange of losses. This exchange must result in our ending up with some effective units. Initially, having fewer units of some UNK especially UNK than the UNK our capabilities need to be sufficiently greater than theirs, so that the exchange will be in our favor. Therefore, the third principle of the plan must be that it does not depend for effectiveness on engagement by the same types, unless at an assured favorable exchange rate. The submarine has increased its effectiveness by several orders of magnitude since World War /2,. Its speed has increased, it operates at increasingly greater UNK its submerged endurance is becoming UNK and it will become even more silent. The next developments will probably be in UNK The missile can gradually be expected to replace the UNK As detection ranges increase, weapons will be developed to attack other submarines and surface craft at these ranges. Therefore, the fourth principle of the plan must be that it provide for continuously increasing capabilities in the UNK No element can accomplish the total objective of submarine defense. Some elements support the others, but all have limitations. Some limitations of one element can be compensated for by a capability of another. UNK used in combination will increase the over-all capability more than the sum of the capabilities of the individual elements. Therefore, the UNK fifth principle must be that it capitalize on the capabilities of all elements in combination. UNK the submarine defense problem can be solved by sufficient forces. Numbers would be astronomical and current fiscal policies make this an impractical solution. UNK aircraft procurement, and weapon programs indicate that there will not be enough of anything. Therefore, any measures taken in peacetime which will decrease force requirements in war will contribute greatly to success when hostilities occur. Therefore, the sixth principle of the plan must be that it concentrate on current measures which will reduce future force requirements. The world is constantly UNK what was new yesterday is UNK today. The seventh principle of the plan is UNK it must be flexible enough to allow for technological UNK scientific progress, and changes in world conditions. UNK UNK IN ~ASW OPERATIONS# To this point the need for an over-all plan for submarine defense has been demonstrated, the mission has been stated, broad principles UNK its content laid down, and the supporting elements UNK Before considering these elements in more detail, an additional requirement should be UNK Large area coverage will accomplish all other tasks. Therefore, because reduction in tasks results in reduction of forces required, the plan should provide for expanding area coverage. But it must be remembered that the plan should not be oriented UNK Consequently, the system giving area coverage (if such coverage is less than world UNK must be flexible and hence at least partially UNK Since effective area coverage appears fairly remote, the requirement can be borne in mind while considering the UNK air, surface, UNK fixed installations, mines, and intelligence. These are arranged approximately in the order of the UNK of their proponents but will be discussed in the reverse order in the hope that the true order of importance will result. ## UNK as used UNK will include information on possible opponents and on the environment which can affect operations. These can be referred to as operational intelligence and environmental intelligence. In submarine defense these must have maximum stress. Good operational intelligence can ensure sound planning, greatly reduce force requirements, and increase tactical UNK UNK intelligence is just as important. The ocean presently UNK with the target. Full knowledge of the science of UNK can bring the environment to our side, resulting in an increase in effectiveness of equipment and tactics, a decrease in enemy UNK and the development of methods of UNK on the environment. Therefore, improved intelligence will result in reduced force requirements and, as it supports all other elements, rates a top UNK UNK intelligence is important, but of equal importance is its translation into usable form. A program is needed to translate the results of UNK research into tactical and operating instructions. UNK this problem on a statistical basis is UNK because the opponent has the same sources available and will be encountered not under average conditions, but under the conditions most advantageous to him. Therefore, the UNK commander must have detailed operating instructions based on measurement of conditions, in the area, at the time of encounter. All capabilities must be used to maximum advantage then. UNK wind, oxygen content, depth, bottom character, and animal life are the chief environmental variables. There may be others. Variations in sound velocity should be measured rather than temperature, because more of the variables would be UNK These variations must eventually be measured UNK as well as UNK Progress in predicting water conditions is UNK but little guidance is available to the man at sea on the use of such information. A concurrent effort is needed to make UNK data useful on the spot. ## UNK UNK has in the past been directed against surface targets. By its nature it has always been of great psychological advantage and small efforts have required considerably greater UNK Mines are being increasingly oriented against submarine targets. They are still considered to be for use in restricted waters, however, and targets must come within a few yards of them. Mines need to be recognized as a major element in anti-submarine warfare employment, extended to deep water, and have their effective area per unit increased. Mines can be used to deny access to great UNK they are difficult to UNK cost little to maintain until required, and can be put into place quickly. A most attractive feature is that detection and attack are combined in a single package. UNK employment will reduce force requirements. For example, effective mine barriers from Florida to Cuba and across the UNK UNK from Cuba to Mexico would remove all requirements for harbor defense, UNK UNK convoy UNK shipping control, and mine defense for the entire Gulf of Mexico. More extended systems, covering all passage into the UNK would free the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico from the previously listed requirements. Systems covering the Gulf of St& Lawrence and possibly the entire coasts of the United States are not impossible. Such mine defense systems could permit concentration of mobile forces in the open UNK with consequent increase in the probability of success. The advantages inherent in mine warfare justify as great an importance for this element as is accorded any of the other elements. ## UNK UNK are increasingly advocated as the problem of area defense UNK The proponents are scientific and technical men who exercise considerable influence on their military counterparts. Systems which detect submarines over wide areas are attractive, although they can be only UNK UNK Mobile forces are required to UNK and attack detected targets, since the systems are not capable of UNK a target. Such systems are expensive and are oriented UNK In an over-all ~ASW UNK dependence on and effort expended for such systems should be limited to those with proven capabilities. No general installation should be made until a model installation has been proved and its maximum capability determined. In addition, proposals for fixed installations should be carefully weighed against a counterpart mobile system. For fixed installations will always lack the flexibility that should be inherent in naval systems. ## <The UNK has become increasingly attractive as an antisubmarine weapon system. It operates in its UNK environment, and any advantage gained UNK by the target is shared by the UNK But the submarine is a weapon of ambush and therefore always in danger of being UNK Two UNK UNK and /2,) of UNK acid UNK which act as UNK for the UNK of UNK by UNK bacteria are UNK from ~PABA.

Some of the previously reported compounds have thus been UNK and a series of new UNK and UNK compounds discovered, the more representative examples being **f, **f, **f, **f and **f (**f).

It furnishes a means of destroying insects in stored grain products as well as certain UNK organisms present in UNK UNK of enzymes is also possible, although some types require extremely heavy doses of 10 UNK or more. Because of undesirable UNK UNK colors, and generally low palatability associated with radiation treatment of this magnitude, the UNK of enzymes is best accomplished prior to irradiation by the conventional UNK methods of UNK Radiation does not retard the chemical spoilage of food. It will, however, inhibit the sprouting of potatoes and other root UNK The radiation doses required for the preservation of foods are in the following UNK _1._ For radiosterilization, to destroy all organisms for long-term UNK about UNK UNK for UNK foods of low salt content. _2._ For UNK to partially destroy UNK results vary with types of food, storage conditions, and objectives of UNK commonly of the order of 0.2 UNK but up to about 0.8 UNK _3._ For destruction of UNK about 25,000 UNK _4._ For UNK the sprouting of root UNK 4,000 to 10,000 UNK UNK foods with ionizing radiation leads to some undesirable side effects, particularly at the higher radiation UNK In this respect, the general palatability and individual acceptance of most UNK foods has, to date, been found to be low in comparison with fresh and commercially processed foods. A number of foods are quite acceptable as regards taste and UNK however, at dosages substantially less than sterilization levels. Moreover, the UNK value of irradiated foods apparently UNK little, if any, change, although some of the UNK vitamins are affected by sterilization UNK UNK UNK For irradiation of food, the results obtained depend upon the dose rather than the specific type of radiation, and UNK UNK and high-energy electron radiation are suitable. Aside from availability and economic considerations, each has certain practical UNK for example, gamma rays give deeper penetration but cannot be focused or UNK whereas UNK electron beams may be split and directed to both the top and bottom of the food package to be UNK UNK of a source for commercial irradiation would involve consideration of numerous factors including required dose rate, load factor, UNK UNK safety, and most important, costs. Of the potentially useful sources of ionizing UNK gamma sources, UNK UNK fission products, or a reactor irradiation loop system using a material such as an UNK salt have received most attention for food-preservation systems. Of the various particle UNK the Van de UNK machines, resonant UNK and linear UNK are the principal ones available for commercial use. Costs of the effective energy produced by these sources is a major obstacle in the development of food-preservation processes. UNK production costs of radiation energy from machine and nuclide sources range from $1 to $10 per UNK UNK energy for processing foods is available in the range of at most a few cents per ~kwhr for electric power and the equivalent of a few mills per ~kwhr for process UNK UNK therefore, is at an initial cost disadvantage even though only 1 to 10 per cent as much radiation energy as heat energy is required for radiopasteurization or UNK What are the possibilities of lowered radiation production costs for the UNK It has been estimated that for applications on a UNK scale costs might reach values in the neighborhood of 10 cents per ~kwhr for large-scale UNK or for gamma radiation generated in a reactor core. No comparable reductions in the cost of nuclide radiation are UNK Such UNK however, appear highly speculative and the capacities involved are far beyond those foreseen for food-preservation facilities. Because agricultural activities are seasonal and the areas of production and harvest of many foods are widely scattered UNK and because of the high cost of transporting bulk food items any substantial distance to a central processing location, the use of large central processing stations, where low-cost radiation facilities approaching the UNK range might be UNK is UNK UNK UNK UNK OF UNK UNK OF FOODS# The objective of complete sterilization of foods is to produce a wholesome and UNK product capable of being stored without refrigeration for extended periods of time. Chief interest in UNK resides in the military services. For them, providing UNK food under battle or emergency conditions is a paramount consideration. They require completely sterile foods capable of being stored without refrigeration, preferably items already cooked and ready to eat. High nutritional value, variety, UNK and UNK appearance are important for reasons of UNK Foods for rear stations, which require cooking, but no refrigeration, are also of interest. Of primary interest are UNK UNK which produces fewer adverse sensory changes in food products, has potential usefulness in UNK the keeping qualities of fresh and refrigerated food items. Thus, food so processed might reach more remote markets and permit the consumer to enjoy more produce at peak UNK and UNK UNK interest is chiefly in this type of treatment, as is military interest under peacetime conditions. The present status of food preservation by ionizing radiation is discussed by food classes in the following UNK UNK The radiation processing of meat has received extensive investigation. To date, the one meat showing favorable results at sterilization doses is UNK Of particular interest to the military services is the demonstration that roast UNK after radiosterilization, is superior in palatability to available canned pork products. UNK with beef have been largely unsuccessful because of the development of UNK A prime objective of the Army UNK Corps program is to find the reasons for UNK low palatability and means of overcoming it, since it is a major and desirable dietary item. UNK because UNK heat treatment is needed to UNK enzymes before radiosterilization, treated fresh meats have the appearance of boiled or canned meat. UNK is a less severe problem with the radiopasteurization of UNK but problems of commercial UNK remain. UNK radiation doses of from 100,000 to 200,000 UNK can extend the shelf life (at 35 UNK of fresh beef from 5 days to 5 or 6 weeks. However, the problem of consumer UNK remains. The UNK blanching process UNK the treated beef and liquid UNK in UNK UNK UNK beef irradiated in the absence of oxygen assumes an unnatural pink color. When lamb and UNK are irradiated at UNK doses, the meat becomes UNK the fat become UNK and, again, unnatural changes in color occur. UNK meats such as fresh pork UNK and UNK have a relatively short shelf life under refrigeration, and radiopasteurization might be thought to offer distinctly improved keeping qualities. However, a major problem here is one of scale of UNK ground meats are usually prepared from scrap meats at the local level, whereas irradiation at economic volumes of production would require central processing and distribution facilities. The problems of color change by blanching and liquid accumulation within the package are the same as for solid UNK UNK cooked items containing meat UNK as in UNK UNK might offer a potential use for UNK The principal potential advantage would be that the finished product could be transported and stored at lower cost under refrigeration instead of being UNK A refrigerated item could also be heated and served in less time than is required for frozen foods of the same type. UNK processes for preserving meats are by canning and UNK Costs of canning meat are in the range of 0.8 to 5 cents per UNK costs of freezing are in the area of 2 to 3.5 cents per UNK The table on page 10 shows costs of canning and freezing meat, and estimated costs for irradiation under certain assumed conditions. Under the conditions of comparison, it will be noted that: _(1)_ UNK (at 3 UNK is more expensive than UNK particularly for the UNK source. _(2)_ UNK by either the electron UNK or UNK source is in the range of freezing costs. _(3)_ UNK using the nuclide source is more expensive than use of an electron UNK UNK Results of irradiation tests with poultry have been quite successful. At UNK doses, good palatability results, with a minimum of changes in appearance, taste, and UNK UNK has also been successful, and the shelf life of chicken can be extended to a month or more under refrigerated storage as compared with about 10 days for the UNK product. UNK taste and odor are retained by the irradiated and refrigerated UNK UNK of radiopasteurization is likely to be delayed, however, for two reasons: (1) the storage life of fresh chicken under refrigeration is becoming a minimal problem because of constantly improved sanitation and distributing practices, and (2) treatment by UNK a measure already approved by the Federal Food and Drug Administration, serves to extend the storage life of chicken at a low cost of about 0.5 cent per UNK UNK UNK UNK products are extremely UNK Although refrigeration has served to extend the storage life of these products, substantially increased consumption might be possible if areas remote from the UNK could be served UNK Furthermore, it has made an exact assessment of the removal mechanisms possible. The instrument is shown in Fig& 1 and consists essentially of a hard, sharp, tungsten UNK knife which is pushed along the substrate to remove the coating. The force required to accomplish removal is UNK by means of an electronic UNK against distance of removal. Since the removal force is a function of coating thickness, a differential UNK pickup has been incorporated into the instrument to accurately measure film thickness. This, too, is recorded against distance by a repeat run over the same track previously cut. A number of adjustment features are included in the Hesiometer to facilitate measurement and permit ready removal of coatings deposited on such UNK as iron and other metals, glass, wood, and plastic surfaces. The measurement of UNK on UNK can also readily be carried out. Hesiometer results have been found to compare excellently with manual knife scratching tests. The instrumental method, however, is about 100 times more sensitive and yields numerical results which can be accurately repeated at UNK over a period of time. If a UNK coating of increasing thickness is removed from a substrate by an instrument like the Hesiometer with a knife of constant rake angle, a number of removal mechanisms are often observed which depend upon the thickness of the coating. At low thicknesses a cutting (or UNK phenomenon is often encountered. As the coating becomes UNK the cutting may abruptly change to a cracking type of failure. If the coating becomes still UNK a peeling type failure finally can occur. The typical appearance of these various mechanisms is illustrated in Figs& 2, 3, and 4, which are single frame UNK of high speed movies taken during the course of the knife removal process. It can be seen from Fig& 2 that the cutting removal of a coating from its substrate involves pure cohesive failure of the coating. The molecular forces holding the coating to the substrate are obviously greater than the cohesive strength of the coating and failure occurs by shear along a plane starting at the tip of the knife and extending to the coating surface. The pictures of Figs& 3 and 4 show the cracking and peeling types of removal where the coating is detached by failure in a region at, or close to, the UNK between coating and substrate. If the force required to remove the coatings is plotted against film thickness, a graph as illustrated schematically in Fig& 5 may characteristically result. Here, ~<H> is the coatings removal force measured parallel to the surface of the substrate and ~<t> is the film thickness. It can be seen that the force is characteristic of the removal process and changes abruptly from cutting to cracking to peeling removal. Also, it can be readily seen that the cutting and peeling types of failure show a steady state response, while the cracking mechanism is of a dynamic nature. It should be recalled that these three mechanisms can occur on the same coating deposited upon the same substrate merely as a function of changes in coatings thickness. Presumably the interfacial bond strength and gross cohesive properties are identical in each case. What then, are the factors that contribute to these UNK Why should the UNK UNK of a coating as assessed by a knife method change, initially increasing rather rapidly and then decreasing stepwise to very low values as the knife is forced through a coating of increasing UNK UNK UNK OF UNK UNK The cutting (or UNK removal process has been previously described. It was found that the coating is separated from its substrate entirely by cohesive failure. The details of the removal process are shown schematically in Fig& 6. The various forces result from the reaction of the removed paint chip against the face of the knife and along the shear plane, which makes an angle ~|f with the substrate. The action and reaction forces are ~<R> and **f, respectively and are equal and opposite in direction. All the other force vectors are derived from these. **f is the force required to cut a coating of thickness ~<t> from the substrate. **f is the shear force along the shear plane; **f and **f are the thrust forces acting against coating and knife, UNK **f is the normal UNK force acting on the shear plane; **f is the friction force between chip and knife UNK and ~<P> is the normal force acting on the face of the knife. ~|a is the rake angle of the UNK ~|f is the angle the shear plane makes with the UNK ~|t is the friction UNK and UNK is the angle the resultants make with the plane of the substrate. An analysis of the vector relationships shows that the rake angle ~|a and the friction angle ~|t determine the vector direction **f of the force resultants ~<R> and **f. Consequently, both the rake angle of the knife as well as the friction occurring between the back of the removed coating and the front of the knife will determine in large part the detailed mechanism of the cutting removal process. It is difficult to measure the direction and magnitude of ~<R> directly. In actual practice, the values most readily amenable to measurement are the cutting force **f and the shear angle UNK These two values and the rake angle ~|a are sufficient to determine the other parameters of these relationships. ~|a is defined by the geometry of the UNK ~|f can readily be determined by measuring the thickness of the coating before and after cutting from the UNK **f is instrumentally determined. From Fig& 6 the relationship between these parameters can readily be derived and the cutting force is **f where ~|l is the shear strength of the coating and is a parameter of the coatings material, UNK is the width of the removed coating and ~<t> is its thickness. If the cutting force, **f is plotted against film thickness, a straight line should result passing through the origin and having slope **f. However, in the actual assessment of the cutting force by instrumental methods for any thickness of coating a number of UNK effects occur which must be taken into account and which make the measured value larger than the true cutting force indicated by eqn& (1). UNK UNK One of these is the fact that the knife UNK no matter how well UNK will have a slightly rounded cutting edge. This UNK that UNK the rake angle, is no longer a constant to zero film thickness. The curvature of this UNK is, in the case of the UNK knife employed in the UNK determined by the grain sizes of the polished UNK and the tungsten UNK crystals cemented together in the knife body and is in the order of 0.1 to 0.2 UNK The force vector concept of Fig& 6 can readily be applied to this condition also. Because the rake angle **f at the tip of the knife is very much smaller (or even UNK when compared to the value of ~|a for the major portion of the knife, a very rapid increase in cutting force with thickness will result. This reduces to the UNK **f where **f is the UNK at zero thickness of the extrapolation of the slope indicated in eqn& (1), **f is the thickness of the coating equivalent to the rounding off of the knife UNK **f is a straight line first approximation of this UNK and the other symbols are equivalent to those of eqn& (1). It can be seen that **f is a constant, and is determined for the most part by the geometry of the knife. The UNK the knife, the higher is the value of **f. The importance of a hard, UNK resistant knife material like the UNK employed in the Hesiometer immediately becomes apparent. UNK knives would blunt very rapidly, making the value of **f UNK In extreme cases of very soft knives this value may even change during the course of a UNK UNK UNK A second factor which enters into the practical measurement of the instrumentally determined cutting force is the UNK resistance caused by the bottom of the knife against the substrate. This is not a constant value like **f, but varies with the thickness of the coating and the direction and magnitude of the resultants ~<R> and **f of Fig& 6. Under equilibrium conditions of cutting the chip exerts a thrust **f against the knife which tends to push it into the substrate or lift it away from the substrate depending on the vector direction of **f. The resultant friction force, **f is thus directly proportional to **f and consequently also to film thickness. The value of **f can readily be assessed by determining the UNK force exerted on the knife while running over the previously stripped coating track under various external UNK A straight line relationship is usually observed in a plot of **f against load UNK having slope UNK and **f Since the load UNK under actual cutting conditions is caused by **f, it can be seen that **f The measured force, UNK in cutting removal of coatings from their UNK consequently can be seen to be the sum of that force required to cut the UNK **f that due to the UNK of the knife, **f, and that due to the friction between the bottom of the knife and the UNK **f, or **f The first two forces are directly interrelated and depend upon film thickness, whereas **f is independent of these two and is a constant for a given UNK combination. These theoretical relationships are more clearly illustrated in Fig& 7 and their sum can be seen to UNK in form with practical measurements made with the Hesiometer as illustrated in the first portion of Fig& 5 for the cutting mechanism. UNK UNK OF UNK UNK Although a large number of coatings systems, particularly at low thicknesses fail UNK by the cutting mechanism, frequently a second type of cohesive failure may also take place. This is a UNK dynamic type failure encountered with very brittle coatings UNK or very highly UNK films. This is shown in the UNK of Fig& 8. The basic difference between the continuous cutting mechanism and that of the UNK mechanism is that instead of shear occurring in the coating ahead of the knife continuously without UNK rupture UNK occurs along the shear plane. The detailed mechanisms of this type of failure have been studied extensively by UNK for metal UNK and the principles found can be directly applied to UNK By studying high speed movies made of this type of failure, the sequence of relationships as schematically illustrated in Fig& 9 could be observed. In the first picture UNK the knife is just beginning to advance into the inclined surface which was left from the previous chip UNK In the next, the shear plane angle is high, and extends to the inclined work surface. With increasing advance of the knife into the coating the shear plane extends to the coatings surface and the shear angle rapidly UNK UNK rupture occurs along the shear plane UNK and the cycle repeats itself. UNK has found that the same basic relationships which describe the geometry and force systems in the case of the cutting mechanism can also be applied to the discontinuous chip formation provided the proper values of instantaneous shear angle and instantaneous chip thickness or cross-sectional area are used. Consequently, if the shear angle ~|f is replaced by the rupture angle **f, the relationships as described in UNK (1), UNK UNK and (6) will directly UNK #THE UNK UNK Under equilibrium cutting conditions, the chip exerts a force **f against the coating and an equal opposite force **f against the knife in the plane of the substrate as shown in Fig& 6. If the rake angle ~|a of the knife is high enough and the friction angle ~|t between the front of the knife and the back of the chip is low enough to give a positive value for **f, the resultant vector ~<R> will lie above the plane of the substrate. Within only a few years, foamed plastics materials have managed to grow into an UNK and important, phase of the plastics UNK and the end is still not yet in sight. Urethane foam, as only one example, was only introduced commercially in this country in UNK Yet last year's volume probably topped 100 million lb& and expectations are for a market of UNK million lb& by UNK Many of the other foamed plastics, particularly the UNK show similar growth potential. And there are even newer foamed plastics that are yet to be UNK As this issue goes to press, for example, one manufacturer has announced an UNK foam with outstanding UNK and impact UNK another reports that a UNK UNK primarily for use in wire coating applications, is being UNK On the following pages, each of the major commercial foamed plastics is described in detail, as to properties, applications, and methods of UNK It might be well to point out, however, some of the newer developments that have taken place within the past few months which might have a bearing on the future of the various foamed plastics involved. In urethane foams, for example, there has been a definite trend toward the UNK materials (which are now available in UNK rigid foam UNK and the emphasis is definitely on one-shot molding. Most manufacturers also seem to be concentrating on UNK UNK or UNK grades of urethane foam that are aimed specifically at the burgeoning building markets. Urethane foam as an UNK is also coming in for a good deal of attention. In one outstanding example, UNK Corp& found that by switching to urethane foam insulation, they could increase the storage capacity of gas UNK to make them competitive with electric models. Much interest has also been expressed in new techniques for processing the urethane foams, including UNK UNK and molding (see article, p& UNK for UNK And in meeting the demands for urethane foam as a garment UNK new UNK and new methods of UNK foam to a substrate have been developed. New techniques for automatic molding of expandable styrene UNK have helped boost that particular material into a number of new consumer applications, including picnic chests, beverage UNK flower UNK and UNK swimming UNK Two other UNK areas which contributed to expandable UNK growth during the year were packaging UNK UNK replacing complicated cardboard UNK and UNK building panels. UNK expandable styrene film or UNK claimed to be competitive UNK with UNK also showed much potential, particularly for UNK UNK panels for building utility shelters that consist of UNK paper skins and rigid styrene foam cores also aroused interest in the construction field. In vinyl foam, the big news was the development of techniques for coating fabrics with the material (for details, see P& UNK Better UNK a more luxurious UNK and better UNK properties were claimed to be the result. Several companies also saw possibilities in using the technique for UNK or molding vinyl products with a slight UNK core that would reduce costs yet would not affect physical properties of the end product to any great extent. UNK interested in additional information on foams are referred to the UNK Plastics UNK appearing in the UNK Data section and to the list of references which appears below. UNK UNK @ Since the UNK UNK when urethane foam first made its appearance in the American market, growth has been little short of UNK Present estimates are that production topped the UNK mark in 1960 UNK to 90 million lb& for UNK 10 or 11 million lb& for UNK by 1965, production may range from 200 to 350 million lb& for flexible and from UNK to 150 million lb& for UNK The markets that have started to open up for the foam in the past year or so seem to justify the expectations. UNK UNK as just one example, can easily take millions of pounds; foamed refrigerator insulation is under intensive evaluation by every major UNK and use of the foam for garment UNK is only now getting off the ground, with volume potential in the UNK UNK UNK Urethane foams are, UNK reaction products of UNK materials and UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK can be either one of two UNK carbon UNK gas generated by the reaction of water on the UNK or mechanical blowing through the use of a UNK liquid such as a UNK UNK The most important factor in determining what properties the UNK will have is quite naturally the type of UNK compound that is used in its production. UNK the main types used were various compositions of UNK These are still in wide use today, particularly in UNK formulations, for such applications as cores for UNK structural panels, UNK insulation, automotive safety UNK arm rests, etc&. More recently, UNK again in varied UNK molecular UNK and UNK have come into use at first for the flexible foams, just lately for the UNK The polyether UNK are claimed to give flexible UNK a UNK action which is much desired in UNK Although the first polyether foams on the market had to be produced by the UNK prepolymer method, today, thanks to new UNK they can be produced by a one-shot technique. It is possible that the polyether foams may soon be molded on a production basis in low-cost molds with more intricate contours and with superior properties to UNK foam. The polyester urethane foam is generally produced with UNK acid UNK the polyether group generally consists of foams produced with UNK UNK or UNK UNK modified with a UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK In the prepolymer system, the UNK and resin are mixed UNK and no foaming occurs. The foaming can be accomplished at some future time at a different location by the addition of the correct proportion of UNK in solution. In UNK the UNK polyester or polyether UNK UNK and other additives are mixed directly and a foam is produced immediately. UNK this means that simpler processing equipment (the mixture has good flowing UNK and less external heat (the foaming reaction is UNK and develops internal UNK are required in one-shot UNK UNK at the same time, the problems of controlling the conditions of one-shot foaming are critical ones. UNK Most commercial uses of urethane foams require UNK between 2 and 30 lb&/cu& ft& for rigid foams, between 1 and 3 lb&/cu& ft& for flexible UNK This latter figure compares with UNK foam rubber at an average of 5.5 lb&/cu& ft& in commercial UNK UNK STRENGTH:_ UNK in Fig& 1, p& UNK indicates how the ratio of UNK strength to density varies as the latter is increased or decreased. The single curve line represents a specific formulation in a test example. By varying the formula, this curve may be moved forward or backward along the coordinates to produce any desired compression UNK UNK UNK UNK AND UNK UNK In flexible urethane foams, we are referring to the range between the highest and lowest temperatures under which the UNK primary performance remains functionally UNK In temperature resistance, this quality is usually related to specific properties, e&g&, UNK tensile UNK etc&. UNK conductivity is directly traceable to the UNK UNK UNK construction which effectively traps air or a gas in the maze of minute bubbles which forms its composition. These air or gas bubbles make highly functional thermal UNK The ~K factor, a term used to denote the rate of heat transmission through a material UNK ft& of UNK of UNK ranges from UNK to UNK for flexible urethane foams and from UNK to UNK for rigid urethane foams, depending upon the UNK density, cell size, and nature of blowing agents used. Table /1,, p& UNK shows a comparison of ~K factor ratings of a number of commercial UNK materials in common use, including two different types of rigid urethane foam. UNK STRENGTH:_ This term refers to the ability of a material to resist UNK stress and is determined by measuring the load required to cause failure by UNK The UNK urethane UNK foams usually have stronger UNK fatigue resistance, i&e&, the 12 lb&/cu& ft& foam has 8 times the flexural strength of the 3 lb&/cu& ft& UNK Note that flexural strength is not always improved by simply increasing the density, nor is the change always proportional from one formulation to another. Where flexural strength is an important factor, be sure that your urethane foam UNK is aware of it. UNK STRENGTH:_ This property refers to the greatest UNK stress or tension a material can endure without tearing apart. Like compression strength of urethane foams, it has a direct relationship to formulation. UNK tensile strength is another of urethane UNK strong features. Figure 2, above, shows the UNK properties of urethane foams as determined by the percent of change in tensile strength during exposure to ultra-violet light. UNK UNK There are many ways of producing a foamed urethane product. The foam can be made into slab stock and cut to shape, it can be UNK it can be UNK it can be applied by spray guns, etc&. UNK stock is still one of the most important forms of urethane UNK in use today. UNK the foam machines that produce such stock consist of two or more pumping units, a variable UNK a nozzle carriage UNK and, in many cases, a conveyor belt to transport and contain the liquid during the reaction process and until it UNK into foam. The ingredients are fed from tanks through a hose and into the UNK at a predetermined rate. The mixing head moves back and forth slowly across the width of the UNK It only takes a few minutes for the foaming action to be completed and after a short UNK the material can be cut into lengths as desired. Much has been done in the way of ingenious UNK to UNK the slab stock into finished products. Profile cutting machines are available which can split foam to any desired thickness and produce UNK UNK UNK and other profiles in variable heights, dimensions, etc&. The UNK sheets can be combined to attain certain UNK effects mechanically rather than UNK Also available is a UNK which UNK the inside of a folded block of foam and can be used to slit continuous sheets up to 300 UNK in length, down to UNK in& thick. The low cost and ease of fabrication of the dies for three-dimensional foam cutting plus the wide variety of shapes, dimensions, and contours that can be UNK to customer requirements has made the technique useful for producing case UNK materials handling UNK packaging and UNK devices, and such novelties as soap dishes, UNK head rests, arch supports, and gas pedal UNK UNK Although slab stock appeared first, it soon became apparent that for the production of UNK with irregular shapes, crowned UNK or rounded edges, the cutting of slab stock is a wasteful and UNK process. Only by resorting to molding techniques can the cushion manufacturer hope to compete satisfactorily in the established cushion market. The closed molding of flexible urethane foams has been a problem ever since the introduction of the material UNK in open molds was more UNK UNK methods for polyester foams and even prepolymer polyether foams were never fully achieved. UNK molding generally resulted in parts weighing more (because of higher UNK than parts UNK from UNK UNK This UNK the gain from having no scrap loss. In addition, there were difficulties with the flow and spreading of the foam mixture over the mold surface, trouble with lack of UNK strength in the rising foam, and problems of UNK The introduction of one-shot polyether foam systems, aided by the development of new UNK helped to alleviate some of the problems of closed molding. While there are still many bugs to be UNK out, the technique is fast UNK UNK UNK Simple systems are available that make it possible for urethane foam components to be UNK UNK etc&, into a UNK where they foam up to fill the void.

This operation requires from 10 to 12 minutes. During the rinsing operation the volume in the tubs gradually increases until UNK from the main drain begins. At this point the drains are UNK so that the suds box drain will discharge directly into the waste line and the main tub drain is set at the 2-1/2 mark on the drain UNK When all of the rinse water has passed from the reservoir to the tubs the main drains are lowered to permit complete UNK of the UNK The run is complete when all the water has drained off into the waste line. By this procedure rinsing progresses in two stages, first by dilution until the time when the drains are separated and thereafter by displacement of the UNK liquor by clean rinse water, since soiled liquor squeezed from the specimens at the UNK passes directly to waste from the suds box UNK This method of rinsing appears to produce maximum UNK with minimum soil UNK UNK UNK AND UNK UNK may be made on either a UNK or a UNK basis as desired.

UNK intensifiers based upon the UNK principle appear to hold promise as far as obtainable resolution is concerned. However, the unavoidable UNK cycle UNK the effective gain. UNK tubes have been constructed showing high gain and resolution. However, electrostatic focus, important for many applications, has not been realized for these devices. UNK limitations with electrostatic focus might be anticipated due to chromatic UNK Furthermore, the thin film UNK appear to have a natural diameter limitation wherever a mesh support cannot be tolerated. UNK single stages enclosed by a UNK UNK have been constructed with high gain and high resolution. These tubes may differ both in the choice of the electron optical system and in the design of the coupling members. The electron optical system may be either a magnetic or electrostatic one. The magnification may be smaller, UNK or larger than unity. An electrostatic system suffers generally from image plane curvature leading to UNK in the peripheral image region if a flat viewing screen (or interstage UNK is UNK while a magnetic system requires accurate adjustment of the UNK which is heavy and UNK As it will be discussed later, peripheral UNK can be improved on by utilizing curved fiber UNK It should be noted, however, that the UNK resolution is quite similar for both electron optical systems. It is felt that UNK UNK (and UNK stage image intensifiers will gain considerable importance in the future. Therefore, we shall consider in this paper the theoretical gain and resolution capabilities of such UNK The luminous efficiency and resolution of single stages, fiber UNK and finally of the composite tube will be computed. It will be shown theoretically that the high image intensification obtainable with such a tube and contact photography permits the utilization of extremely low incident light levels. The effect of device and quantum noise, associated with such low input levels, will be described. After these theoretical considerations, UNK details of a UNK UNK X-ray image intensifier will be UNK UNK performance characteristics for this experimental tube will be UNK The conclusion shall be reached that UNK UNK tubes represent a sensible and practical approach to UNK image UNK UNK UNK OF A UNK UNK UNK UNK The tube design which forms the basis of the theoretical discussion shall be described now. The electron optical system (see fig& UNK is based in principle on the focusing action of UNK spherical cathode and anode surfaces. The inner UNK sphere is UNK elongated into a cup, and terminated by the phosphor screen. The UNK emitted from a circular segment of the cathode sphere are focused by the positive lens action of the two UNK UNK pass through the UNK lens formed by the anode UNK and UNK upon the cathodoluminescent viewing screen. The cylindrical focusing electrode permits adjustment of the positive lens part by varying the focusing potential. The anode potential UNK the UNK UNK and UNK UNK of the stage. Both the photocathode and the image plane of such an electrode configuration are curved concave as seen from the anode UNK The UNK property of the UNK fiber coupler can be utilized to alleviate the peripheral resolution losses resulting with a flat UNK or coupling member. For the same reason, the output fiber plate is UNK its exposed flat side permitting contact photography if a permanent record is desired. As it will be shown later, the UNK properties of the interstage and output fiber coupler comprise indeed the main advantage of such a design. The second photocathode and both phosphor surfaces are deposited on the fiber plate UNK The photocathode UNK UNK phosphor UNK ~<P>, and anode potentials ~<V> of the individual stages shall be distinguished by means of UNK /1, and /2, in the text, where required. Both stages are assumed to have unity UNK UNK UNK OF UNK UNK UNK UNK OF A UNK UNK The luminous gain of a single stage with **f UNK UNK is, to a first UNK given by the product of the photocathode sensitivity UNK UNK the anode potential ~<V> UNK and the phosphor conversion efficiency ~<P> UNK In general, ~<P> is a function of ~<V> and the current density, but it shall here be assumed as a constant. The luminous efficiency **f of a photocathode depends on the maximum radiant sensitivity **f and on the spectral distribution of the incident light **f by the UNK **f where **f **h UNK radiant photocathode sensitivity. **f **h standard visibility function. The luminous flux gain of a single stage is given by: **f If the input light distribution falls beyond the visible range, **f as expected, since **f. Such cases are not considered here. UNK OF UNK UNK The efficiency of fiber UNK plates depends on four UNK _(A)_ numerical aperture UNK _(B)_ end UNK UNK losses UNK _(C)_ internal losses UNK _(D)_ packing efficiency UNK The numerical aperture of the fibers is given by: **f where **f. The angle **f is measured in the medium of index **f. UNK UNK as generally used in image UNK have low optical contact with the substrate surface, hence **f shall be UNK The numerical aperture should be in general close to unity. This condition can be satisfied, e&g&, with **f and **f or equivalent glass combinations. A sufficiently good approximation for determining the end reflection losses ~<R> can be obtained from the angle independent UNK formula: **f For phosphor to fiber and fiber to air UNK and assuming **f, we obtain **f percent. This value may be reduced to UNK percent by means of a UNK UNK glass layer of index UNK Hence, the **f factor for the output fiber coupler is **f. As the index of UNK of UNK surfaces of the UNK lies around 2, the UNK losses at the UNK UNK are about 0.5 percent and the **f factor for the interstage coupler is UNK It might be anticipated that multiple coatings will reduce end reflection losses even further. The internal losses are due to absorption and the small but finite losses suffered in the numerous internal reflections due to deviations from the UNK cylindrical fiber cross-section and minute UNK of the UNK UNK These losses depend on fiber diameter and length, absorption UNK the mean value of the loss per internal reflection and last but not least, on the angular distribution of the incident light. UNK expressions UNK UNK are given in the literature. Lacking reliable data for some of the variables, we are relying on experimental data of about 20 percent internal losses for UNK long, small UNK diameter fibers. This relatively high value is probably due to the small fiber diameters increasing the number of internal UNK Since we are considering here relatively small diameter UNK UNK fiber plates, their average thickness can be kept below 1/4 inch and their internal losses may be assumed as 15 percent UNK UNK The packing efficiency, UNK of fiber plates did not receive much attention in the literature, probably as it is high for the larger fibers generally used, until rather recently. For circular fibers in a closely packed UNK UNK the packing efficiency is given by: **f where **f, and UNK is the ratio of the area of a circle to that of the UNK UNK For the small diameter fibers now technically feasible and required for about 100 **f resolution, **f. The UNK thickness is about UNK hence, **f and **f. Thus, the efficiency ~|t UNK is given UNK **f or approximately 50 percent each. It must be remembered that the fiber plates replace a glass window and a UNK UNK in addition to an optical output lens system. The efficiency **f of an **f lens at the magnification **f is: **f UNK UNK the end losses of the coupling membrane and the output window **f would be 6 percent and 8 percent. Thus, the combined efficiency of the elements replaced by the two fiber plates (with a combined efficiency of UNK is UNK or UNK six times less than that of the two fiber UNK UNK OF UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK the brightness gain **f due to the **f area UNK the overall gain of a fiber coupled double stage image intensifier is: **f It is obvious that the careful choice of photocathode which maximizes **f for a given input UNK (in the case of the second stage, for the first phosphor screen UNK is very important. The same consideration should govern the choice of the UNK phosphor screen for matching with the spectral sensitivity of the ultimate UNK (e&g&, photographic UNK We have evaluated the UNK UNK for two types of UNK UNK and UNK and three types of light UNK The input light distributions considered are UNK and ~P-20 phosphor emission and the so-called UNK UNK UNK as given by UNK UNK and J& J& Johnson. The UNK (in @ UNK are listed in table UNK below: UNK UNK OF UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK IN A UNK UNK The resolution limitations for a single stage are given by the inherent resolution of the electron optical system as well as the resolution capabilities of the cathodoluminescent viewing screen. The resolution capabilities of an electrostatic system depend on both the choice of magnification and chromatic UNK It has been stated previously that a UNK electrostatic system yields a lower resolution than a UNK system or a system with unity UNK Furthermore, the chromatic aberrations depend on the chosen high UNK In general, a high anode voltage reduces chromatic aberrations and thus increases the obtainable resolution. The luminous gain of the discussed tube was calculated from UNK (6) for the 16 possible combinations of UNK and UNK UNK and UNK and ~P-20 phosphor UNK for night light and ~P-20 light UNK (The ~P-20 input is of interest because it corresponds roughly to the light emission of conventional X-ray UNK UNK The following UNK obtained from UNK and ~RCA specifications were UNK **f The following table UNK lists the UNK gain values computed according to UNK (6) with UNK The possibility of a space charge UNK of the screen UNK of the elementary electron bundles has been pointed out.

Space charge influences will also decrease at increased UNK UNK systems of the UNK type have been tested for resolution capabilities by applying UNK A resolution of UNK UNK per UNK appears to be feasible. The inherent resolution of a cathodoluminescent phosphor screen decreases with increasingly aggregate thickness (with increasing anode UNK decreases with decreasing UNK UNK the advantage of UNK phosphor UNK and might be impaired by the normally used aluminum mirror. Thus, in general, elementary light optical effects, light UNK and electron UNK determine the obtainable resolution UNK It should be noted that UNK due to UNK generated within the viewing screen by electron impact, appears to be important only if anode UNK in excess of 30 UNK are UNK It has been stated that settled cathodoluminescent phosphor UNK may have a limiting resolution of 60 **f at high voltage values of approximately 20 UNK For the further discussion, we shall thus assume an electron optical resolution of 80 **f and phosphor screen resolution of 60 **f. The set of all decisions is called the operating policy or, more simply, the policy. An optimal policy is one which in some sense gets the best out of the process as a whole by maximizing the value of the product. There are thus three components to an optimal design problem: _(1)_ The specification of the state of the process UNK _(2)_ The specification of the operating variables and the transformation they UNK _(3)_ The specification of the objective function of which the UNK is desired. For a chemical process the first of these might involve the concentrations of the different chemical species, and the temperature or pressure of the stream. For the second we might have to choose the volume of reactor or amount of cooling to be UNK the way in which the transformation of state depends on the operating variables for the main types of reactors is discussed in the next chapter. The objective function is some measure of the increase in value of the stream by UNK it is the subject of Chapter 4. The essential characteristic of an optimal policy when the state of the stream is transformed in a sequence of stages with no feedback was first isolated by UNK He recognized that whatever transformation may be effected in the first stage of an ~<R>-stage process, the remaining stages must use an optimal **f-stage policy with respect to the state resulting from the first stage, if there is to be any chance of UNK the complete process. Moreover, by systematically varying the operating conditions in the first stage and always using the optimal **f-stage policy for the remaining stages, we shall eventually find the optimal policy for all ~R stages. Proceeding in this way, from one to two and from two to three stages, we may gradually build up the policy for any number. At each step of the calculation the operating variables of only one stage need be varied. To see how important this economy is, let us suppose that there are UNK operating variables at each stage and that the state is specified by ~<n> UNK then the search for the maximum at any one stage will require a number of operations of order **f (where ~<a> is some number not UNK UNK To proceed from one stage to the next a sufficient number of feed states must be investigated to allow of UNK this number will be of the order of **f. If, however, we are seeking the optimal ~<R>-stage policy for a given feed state, only one search for a maximum is required at the final step. Thus a number of operations of the order of **f are required. If all the operating variables were varied simultaneously, **f operations would be required to do the same job, and as ~<R> increases this increases very much more rapidly than the number of operations required by the dynamic program. But even more important than this is the fact that the direct search by simultaneously varying all operating conditions has produced only one optimal policy, namely, that for the given feed state and ~<R> stages. In contrast, the dynamic program produces this policy and a whole family of policies for any smaller number of stages. If the problem is enlarged to require a complete coverage of feed states, **f operations are needed by the dynamic program and **f by the direct UNK But **f is vastly larger than UNK No optimism is more UNK than that which believes that the high speed of modern digital computers allows for use of the UNK of methods in searching out a result. Suppose that **f, and that the average operation requires only **f UNK Then the dynamic program would require about a minute whereas the direct search would take more than three UNK The principle of optimality thus brings a vital organization into the search for the optimal policy of a UNK decision process. UNK UNK has UNK in the following UNK "An optimal policy has the property that whatever the initial state and initial decision are, the remaining decisions must constitute an optimal policy with respect to the state resulting from the first UNK This is the principle which we will invoke in every case to set up a functional UNK It appears in a form that is admirably suited to the powers of the digital computer. At the same time, every device that can be employed to reduce the number of variables is of the greatest value, and it is one of the attractive features of dynamic programming that room is left for ingenuity in using the special features of the problem to this end. UNK THE UNK UNK PROCESS# Consider the process illustrated in Fig& UNK consisting of ~<R> distinct stages. These will be numbered in the direction opposite to the flow of the process stream, so that stage ~<r> is the UNK stage from the end. Let the state of the stream leaving stage ~<r> be denoted by a vector **f and the operating variables of stage ~<r> by **f. Thus **f denotes the state of the feed to the ~<R>-stage process, and **f the state of the product from the last stage. Each stage transforms the state **f of its feed to the state **f in a way that depends on the operating variables **f. We write this **f. This transformation is uniquely determined by **f and we therefore speak of the process as UNK In practical situations there will be restrictions on the admissible operating conditions, and we regard the vectors as belonging to a fixed and bounded set UNK The set of vectors **f constitutes the operating policy or, more briefly, the policy, and a policy is admissible if all the **f belong to UNK When the policy has been chosen the state of the product can be obtained from the state of the feed by repeated application of the transformation UNK thus **f. The objective function, which is to be UNK is some function, usually UNK continuous, of the product state. Let this be denoted by **f. An optimal policy is an admissible policy **f which maximizes the objective function ~<P>. The policy may not be unique but the maximum value of ~<P> certainly is, and once the policy is specified this maximum can be calculated by (2) and (3) as a function of the feed state **f. Let **f where the maximization is over all admissible policies **f. When it is necessary to be specific we say that the optimal policy is an optimal ~<R>-stage policy with respect to the feed state **f. For any choice of admissible policy **f in the first stage, the state of the stream leaving this stage is given by **f. This is the feed state of the subsequent **f stages which, according to the principle of UNK must use an optimal **f-stage policy with respect to this state. This will result in a value **f of the objective function, and when **f is chosen correctly this will give **f, the maximum of the objective function. Thus **f where the maximization is over all admissible policies **f, and **f is related to **f by UNK The sequence of equations (6) can be solved for **f when **f is known, and clearly **f, the maximization being over all admissible **f. The set of equations UNK UNK and the starting equation (7) is of a UNK type well suited to programming on the digital computer. In finding the optimal ~<R>-stage policy from that of **f stages, only the function **f is needed. When **f has been found it may be transferred into the storage location of **f and the whole calculation repeated. We also see how the results may be presented, although if ~<n>, the number of state variables, is large any UNK will become UNK A table or set of tables may be set out as in Table UNK To extract the optimal ~<R>-stage policy with respect to the feed state **f, we enter section ~<R> of this table at the state **f and find immediately from the last column the maximum value of the objective function. In the third column is given the optimal policy for stage UNK and in the UNK the resulting state of the stream when this policy is used. Since by the principle of optimality the remaining stages use an optimal **f-stage policy with respect to **f, we may enter section **f of the table at this state **f and read off the optimal policy for stage **f and the resulting state **f. Proceeding in this way up the table we extract the complete optimal policy and, if it is desired, we can check on **f by evaluating **f at the last stage. It may be that the objective function depends not only on **f but also on **f, as when the cost of the operating policy is considered. A moment's reflection shows that the above UNK and presentation work equally well in this case. A form of objective function that we shall often have occasion to consider is **f. Here UNK represents the value of the stream in state UNK and UNK the cost of operating the stage with conditions UNK Hence ~<P> is the increase in value of the stream minus the cost of operation, that is, the net UNK If **f denotes the net profit from stage ~<r> and **f then the principle of optimality gives **f This sequence of equations may be started with the remark that with no process **f there is no profit, i&e&, **f. UNK THE UNK UNK PROCESS# The process in which the outcome of any one stage is known only UNK is also of interest, although for chemical reactor design it is not as important as the deterministic process. In this case the stage ~<r> operating with conditions **f transforms the state of the stream from **f to **f, but only the probability distribution of **f is known. This is specified by a distribution function **f such that the probability that **f lies in some region ~<D> of the stage space is **f. We cannot now speak of maximizing the value of the objective function, since this function is now known only in a UNK sense. We can, however, UNK its expected value. For a single stage we may define **f where the maximization is by choice of **f. We thus have an optimal policy which maximizes the expected value of the objective function for a given **f. If we consider a process in which the outcome of one stage is known before passage to the next, then the principle of optimality shows that the policy in subsequent stages should be optimal with respect to the outcome of the first. Then **f, the maximization being over all admissible **f and the integration over the whole of stage space. The type of presentation of results used in the deterministic process may be used here, except that now the fourth column is UNK The third column gives the optimal policy, but we must wait to see the outcome of stage ~<R> and enter the preceding section of the table at this state. The discussion of the optimal policy when the outcome of one stage is not known before passing to the next is a very much more difficult matter. UNK THE UNK UNK PROCESS# In many cases it is not possible to divide the process into a finite number of discrete stages, since the state of the stream is transformed in a continuous manner through the process. We replace UNK the number of the stage from the end of the process, by ~<t>, a continuous variable which measures the UNK of the point considered from the end of the process. The word UNK is used here in a rather general UNK it may in fact be the time that will UNK before the end of the process. If ~<T> is the total UNK of the process, its feed state may be denoted by a vector UNK and the product state by UNK UNK denotes the state at any point ~<t> and UNK the vector of operating variables there. A gyro-stabilized platform system, using restrained UNK is well suited for automatic leveling because of the characteristics of the UNK combination. The restrained gyro-stabilized platform with reasonable response characteristics operates with an approximate equation of motion, neglecting UNK effects, as follows: **f where UNK is a torque applied about the output axis of the controlling UNK The platform angle ~|f is the angle about which the gyro is UNK This is normally termed the gyro input axis, UNK away from the gyro output or UNK axis. The gyro angular momentum is defined by UNK Thus if the gyro and UNK combination maintains the platform with zero angular deviation about the ~|f axis, the system can be rotated with an angular velocity **f if a torque is supplied to the gyro output axis UNK It is assumed that the UNK are designed with electrical torquers so that a torque can be applied about their output UNK In the system shown in Fig& UNK the accelerometer output is amplified and the resulting voltage is applied to the gyro UNK UNK This torque causes the entire system to UNK about the ~|f axis, since the response to **f. If the UNK are correct, the platform UNK in such a direction as to reduce the accelerometer output to zero. As the accelerometer output is UNK the torque applied to the gyro output axis decreases and, therefore, the rate UNK Finally, when the accelerometer output is UNK the entire system remains UNK and the platform is, by definition, UNK A mathematical block diagram for the leveling system is shown in Fig& UNK The platform is initially off level by the angle UNK The angle generated by the platform servo ~|f multiplied by ~<g> is the effective acceleration acting on the UNK **f is the scale factor of the accelerometer (**f). The voltage **f is amplified by **f and applied to the gyro torquer with scale factor **f. Finally, the gyro-stabilized platform characteristic is represented by **f The system as indicated in Fig& UNK is fundamental and simple because the UNK effects of both the platform servo and the accelerometer have been neglected. With these factors UNK an upper limit is placed on the allowable loop gain by stability UNK In this type of system, a high loop gain is desirable because it provides a fast response time. When the frequency response characteristics of practical components are considered, their effect on stability does not present the most serious limit on the system loop gain. The time required for the system to reach a level position is approximately inversely proportional to the servo loop gain. In addition, the UNK frequency for input UNK is approximately proportional to the servo loop UNK i&e&, high loop gain causes the system to respond to horizontal components of UNK This problem usually determines the lower limit of loop gain rather than response time. It must be noticed in Fig& 7-1 that the accelerometer responds to any input UNK The equation relating input acceleration to output platform angle is **f In practice, the UNK leveling process takes place with the system mounted in the UNK When the system is arranged for automatic leveling, the platform angles respond to any horizontal components of acceleration acting on the UNK There are many such components of acceleration present due to the effect of wind UNK engine noise, turbulence around the vehicle, etc&. One of the greatest problems associated with automatic leveling is establishing a true level in the presence of UNK acceleration noise. One solution to the problem is to operate with a low loop gain and to include UNK UNK This technique causes the system to respond only to low frequency acceleration components such as the platform UNK Since a lower loop gain and UNK filtering increases the response time, a practical compromise must be reached. One of the most desirable solutions is achieved by the use of a UNK amplifier for **f. The amplifier is designed so that its gain is large for accelerometer signals above a certain threshold level. Below this level, the amplifier gain **f is proportional and is of small value, in order to provide adequate noise UNK The effect is that the platform returns from an UNK position at a rapid rate until it is nearly level, at which point the platform is controlled by a proportional servo with low enough frequency response so that the noise has little effect on the leveling process. When the system is on automatic leveling, the gyro drift is canceled by the output of the leveling system UNK **f). The platform actually UNK off level so that the accelerometer output, when amplified by **f, will supply the correct current to the gyro torquer to cancel the gyro drift. The amount of platform dip required depends upon the scale factors of the system. UNK UNK UNK UNK The automatic leveling system described in this section is readily UNK to a gyro-stabilized platform consisting of three UNK UNK The system requires some switching of flight equipment UNK However, the leveling operation can be maintained and controlled remotely with no mechanical or optical contact with the platform. This leveling system will hold the platform UNK UNK as long as the system is UNK A useful UNK of this system is that the information necessary to set the gyro drift UNK is available from the currents necessary to hold the system in level. The leveling process can be accomplished UNK and the results are as satisfactory as those obtained with automatic equipment. The process consists in turning the platform UNK until the outputs of both accelerometers are zero. The turning is accomplished by applying voltage to the gyro torquers described above. In brief, the human replaces amplifier **f in Figs& 7-1 and UNK UNK leveling requires an appropriate display of the accelerometer UNK If high accuracy is required in UNK leveling, it is usually necessary to integrate or doubly integrate the accelerometer outputs (this also UNK the noise UNK With integration, the effect of a small acceleration (or small platform tilt UNK can be seen after a time. However, skill is required on the part of an operator to level a platform to any degree of accuracy. Also, it requires more time as compared to the automatic approach. UNK leveling is UNK if the platform must be maintained accurately level for any prolonged period of time. The operator must continually supply the correct amount of turning current to the gyro torquers so that the effect of gyro drift is UNK This process is especially difficult since gyro drifting is typically random. UNK UNK UNK UNK heading consists of orienting the sensitive axis of the accelerometers parallel to the desired coordinate system of the UNK In simpler terms, it amounts to pointing the platform in the proper direction. For purely inertial UNK two techniques are available to accomplish the platform UNK _1._ Use of external or surveying equipment to establish proper heading. _2._ Use of the characteristics of the platform components for an indication of true heading The choice of the heading technique is dependent upon the accuracy requirements, field conditions, and the time available to accomplish the heading. UNK UNK UNK OF UNK UNK UNK With the gyro-stabilized platform UNK it can be headed in the proper direction by using surveying techniques. The platform accelerometers must be slightly modified for this procedure. Before the accelerometers are mounted on the UNK the direction of their sensitive axis must be accurately determined. A mirror is mounted on each accelerometer so that the plane of the mirror is UNK to the sensitive axis of the unit. UNK A precision transit is set up so that it is aligned with respect to true north. This can be done to a high degree of accuracy by existing surveying techniques. With the transit set up, a mirror on one of the accelerometers is sighted and the platform is turned until it is UNK The UNK procedure includes the use of a UNK for the transit to project a beam of light, which is UNK by crossed UNK on the accelerometer mirror. When the platform is UNK the reflected image of the crossed hairs can be seen exactly superimposed upon the original crossed UNK The images can easily be aligned with a high degree of accuracy. The platform is turned as required by supplying currents to the appropriate gyro UNK Although this technique is simple and UNK one practical difficulty does UNK the direction of true north must be known for each launch point. However, this difficulty is not too serious if it is realized that a surveying team can establish a true north base line with a few UNK work. In many installations, the inertial platform is raised off the ground a considerable height when it is mounted in the vehicle before flight. With this situation, it is difficult to sight in on the platform with surveying equipment. If the platform is not too high off the ground, a transit can be mounted on a stand to raise it up to the platform. Obviously, the heading accuracy is lessened by such techniques since errors are introduced because of motion of the stand. UNK The transit can be replaced by an UNK This instrument provides an electrical signal proportional to the angular deviations of the platform and can be used to automatically hold the platform on true heading. The electrical signal from the autocollimator is amplified and supplied to the UNK UNK If the polarity is correct, the platform will turn until the heading error angle is zero. Information is also available from this autocollimator system to set the drift bias for the UNK UNK If the UNK gyro is UNK a current generated by the autocollimator is delivered to the gyro torquer to cancel the drift. If the drift error is UNK it can be canceled with a bias circuit which can be arranged and adjusted to supply the required UNK current. UNK UNK It is possible to locate an angular electrical UNK which will indicate the angular deviation between the true heading direction and the platform. UNK the UNK or reference portion of the UNK is established with respect to the true heading direction, and the platform is turned either UNK or automatically until the angular electrical UNK signal is reduced to zero. UNK UNK UNK UNK alignment is an automatic heading system which depends upon the characteristic of one gyro to establish true heading. For the case of a purely inertial UNK consisting of three restrained UNK a coordinate system is used where the sensitive axis of the ~<X> accelerometer is parallel to the east-west direction at the base point, and the UNK accelerometer sensitive axis is parallel to the UNK direction at the base point. The accelerometers are mounted rigidly on the platform. Thus, if one accelerometer is properly UNK the other is also. The input axis of the appropriate UNK are parallel to the sensitive direction of the UNK Figure UNK shows a platform system with the gyro vectors arranged as described above. The platform is leveled and properly headed, so that the UNK input axis is parallel to the east-west direction and the UNK input axis is parallel to the UNK direction. The input axis of the ~<X> UNK when pointing in the east-west direction, is always UNK to the spin axis of earth. If the platform is not properly headed, the UNK input axis will see a component of the earth's UNK The sensing of this rotation by the ~<X> gyro can be utilized to direct the platform into proper heading. In Fig& UNK the input axis of the UNK platform is shown at some point on the earth. The point is at a latitude ~|l, and the platform is at an error in heading east. The earth is spinning at an angular velocity UNK equal to one revolution per 24 UNK When the platform is level, UNK is a rotation about the UNK axis of the platform **f. Since the earth is rotating and the UNK gyro-stabilized platform is fixed with respect to a reference in space, an observer on the earth will see the platform rotating (with respect to the UNK UNK UNK did not go back to school. His parents talked seriously and UNK to their own doctor and to a specialist at the University UNK Mr& McKinley was entitled to a discount for members of his family- and it was decided it would be best for him to take the remainder of the term off, spend a lot of time in bed and, for the rest, do pretty much as he UNK UNK of course, he chose to do nothing too exciting or too UNK His teacher and his school principal were conferred with and everyone agreed that, if he kept up with a certain amount of work at home, there was little danger of his losing a term. Scotty accepted the decision with indifference and did not enter the UNK He was discharged from the hospital after a two-day UNK and he and his parents had what Mr& McKinley described as a UNK UNK at the cafeteria on the campus. Rachel wore a smart hat and, because she had been warned recently about UNK puffed at her UNK through a long ivory holder stained with UNK Scotty's father sat sprawled in his chair, UNK alert as a UNK looking about at the huge UNK appointments of the room with an expression of UNK UNK men who wore brown suits and had gray hair and pleasant UNK came to their table to talk shop and to be introduced to Scotty and Rachel. Rachel was UNK Scotty UNK They ate the cafeteria food with its orange sauces and Scotty gazed without interest at his food, the teachers, the heroic UNK windows, and the bright ranks of college UNK His father tried to make the food a UNK "The UNK pie is good, UNK I recommend it". He looked at his son, his face worried. Scotty UNK "No, UNK so softly his father had to bend his UNK height across the table and turn a round brown ear to him.

He said more UNK "I'm full, old UNK He had eaten almost nothing on the UNK UNK plate and had drunk about half the milk in its paper UNK "He's all right, UNK Rachel said.

Altogether he had, since the UNK the appearance of a boy who UNK in food and took no exercise. He looked lazy, UNK a little UNK Rachel had little to say. She greeted her husband's colleagues with smiling UNK offering nothing. Mr& UNK for all his UNK and his easy UNK was completely alert to his son, eyes always on the still face, UNK to anticipate Scotty's desires. It was a UNK silent UNK Rachel said, "I'd better get him to UNK The doctors had suggested Scotty remain most of every afternoon in bed until he was stronger. Since Mr& McKinley had to give a lecture, Rachel and Scotty drove home alone in the Plymouth. They did not speak much. Scotty gazed out at ugly gray slums and said UNK UNK at those stupid UNK It was a Negro section of peeling row houses, UNK churches and UNK children. Rachel had to bend toward Scotty and ask him to repeat. He said, UNK And UNK "There are lots of kids around here". Scotty looked at the children, his mouth slightly opened, his eyes dull. He felt tired and full and calm. UNK THE days seemed short, perhaps because his routine was, each day, almost the same. He rose late and went down in his UNK and UNK to have breakfast either alone or with Rachel. Virginia treated him with attention and tried to UNK his appetite with special UNK UNK UNK UNK the result of devoted hours in the tiled kitchen. She would hover over him and, looking like her brother, anxiously watch the progress of Scotty's fork or UNK "You don't eat enough, honey. Try to get that UNK Rachel, UNK would say, "He has to UNK his own capacity. UNK take time". Virginia and Rachel talked to each other quietly now, as allies who are political rather than natural might in a war atmosphere. Both watched Scotty UNK Rachel without seeming to, Virginia openly, her eyes filled with concern. Scotty was UNK He did not resent their supervision or Virginia's sometimes UNK UNK He ate what he felt like, slept as much or as little as he UNK and moved about the UNK rooms of the house, when he was not in bed, with slow dubious steps, like an elderly tourist in a UNK His energy was gone. He was UNK now, to sit for hours in a chair in the living room and stare out at the bleak yard without moving. His hands lay UNK yet UNK they were like wax UNK almost UNK not UNK folded in his lap; his mouth hung slightly open. When he was asked a question or addressed in such a way that some response was UNK he would UNK if, as often happened, he had to repeat because he had spoken too UNK he would repeat his words in the same way, without emphasis or UNK only a little louder. He had not mentioned Kate. He had not even thought about her much except once or twice at night in bed when his slowly ranging thoughts would UNK almost UNK encounter her. At these times he felt a kind of pain in his upper chest, but it was an objective pain, in no way different from others in intensity and not different in UNK it was like the UNK wound on the back of his head which occasionally UNK it was merely another part of his weakness. He was calm, UNK and UNK He did not care. Rachel mentioned Kate. She said, "I notice the girl from across the street hasn't bothered to phone or UNK Scotty said, "That's all right. Kate's all right". He thought about it briefly, then deliberately turned the talk to something else. Once, sitting at the front window in his parents' room, he saw Kate come out of her house. She was with UNK They were far off and looked UNK The heavy branches in his front yard would hide and then reveal them. They turned at the bottom of Kate's steps and moved off in the direction of the park. He thought he UNK it awakened and, for a moment, interested him- that Elizabeth held a UNK in her hand and that a round fuzzy UNK was on the end of the UNK Then they disappeared and Scotty got up and went into his own room and got into bed. By the time he was under the covers he had forgotten about seeing Kate. The doctor, since Scotty was no longer allowed to make his regular trips into town to see him, came often and informally to the house. He would sit, UNK and UNK on the edge of Scotty's bed, his legs crossed so elaborately that the crossed foot could tap the floor. Scotty did not mind the doctor's UNK UNK as he used to.

UNK The doctor had to bend close to UNK his delicate hand, as UNK as a UNK wing, rested absently on Scotty's chest. Scotty said the same words more UNK UNK Well, we're taking a little UNK that's all". He turned UNK to Rachel. "I think by the end of next week he could get out in the air a little. He could now but the weakness is very UNK it would exhaust him further and UNK He'll be stronger UNK His UNK was on the table by Scotty's bed and he picked it up and UNK it at UNK He said UNK "Just keep the cap on those strong UNK The UNK UNK silver in the darkening room. "I'll drop by again in a few days". Rachel stayed on after the doctor had gone. She smoothed the covers on Scotty's bed and picked things up from the floor. She did not touch him. Scotty watched with UNK He did not speak. He had no desire to. She said, "Do you think you'll miss UNK He had noticed how formal and UNK exact Rachel had UNK He did not care. He felt her UNK did not concern him, yet he knew he would not care even if it did. He shook his head. "We've had any number of calls about you. You could win a popularity contest at that school without any trouble. Miss UNK called twice. She wants to pay you a visit. She says the children miss you. Apparently you were the light of their UNK Scotty UNK slightly. Rachel came close to the bed, bent as if she would kiss him, then moved away. She was UNK "That doctor UNK me". She seemed to speak to herself. "Do you suppose his UNK is characteristic of the new Negro professionals or merely of doctors in UNK She turned to him again. "Well, Mrs& UNK UNK has UNK too.

"She didn't really UNK She glanced away at the floor, then UNK UNK and picked up one of Scotty's UNK "I mean, do you feel like seeing UNK Scotty said, "I don't UNK It was true. He did not. There was the slight pain, but it was no different from the UNK in his head. "Well, there's time, in any case. We'll wait till you're stronger and then talk about it". She put the UNK neatly by its mate at the foot of the bed. Scotty said, UNK This time Rachel kissed him lightly on the UNK Scotty was pleased. His father was a constant visitor. Scotty would hear the front door in the evening and then his father's deep slow UNK it floated up the stairs. UNK UNK And UNK or Virginia's UNK UNK He's getting plenty of UNK "Is his appetite UNK UNK "Does he get UNK The exchange was almost UNK and UNK in his bed, could hear every word of it. He never smiled. It required an energy he no longer possessed to be satirical about his father. His father would come upstairs and stand UNK at the foot of the bed and look at his son. After a UNK during which he studied Scotty's face as if Scotty were not there and could not study him too, Mr& McKinley would ask the same questions he had asked UNK Scotty would reply softly and his father, UNK would ask him to repeat. "I'm eating UNK he would say. UNK "I walk around the house a UNK UNK you should get out a UNK "I'm not supposed to UNK He was not UNK He did not mind the UNK kindly questions. He looked at the lined face with vague UNK he felt he was noting it, as if it were something he might think about when he grew stronger.

He had come because he could not live out his life feeling that he had been a UNK ## There were ten men on the patrol which Sergeant Prevot led out that next night. The beaming UNK was carrying a UNK machine UNK another man UNK the UNK and a box of UNK Warren and White each UNK in addition to their own weapons and UNK a box of UNK for the UNK machine gun. Others carried extra UNK for the Browning UNK UNK which was in the hands of a little Mexican named Martinez. Prevot had UNK the two new men that afternoon. "We just sit quiet and UNK Prevot had said. UNK sure the man nearest you is awake. If Joe doesn't show up, we'll all be back here at UNK hours. Otherwise, we hold a reception.

Warren tried to shake off the jumble of his fears by looking at the sky. It was dark. Prevot had said that the UNK would be bounced off the clouds at UNK hours, UNK gives us time to get settled in UNK Because they were new men and to be sure that they didn't get lost, Prevot had placed Warren and White in the center of the patrol as it filed out. His eyes now fixed on White's solid figure, Warren could hear behind him the UNK of another. He could also hear the stream which he had seen from his position. They were going to follow it for part of their journey. "It's UNK Prevot had said, "and it provides cover for our UNK Soon they were picking their way along the edge of the stream which glowed in the night. On their right rose the embankment covered with brush and trees. If a branch extended out too far, each man held it back for the next, and if they met a low UNK each warned the other. Thus, UNK they advanced UNK then they turned to the right, climbed the UNK and walked into the valley again. There was no cover here, only grass UNK against UNK And with each UNK like a whip in the hand of an expert, the grass stripped something from Warren. The gentle UNK of each UNK left him more naked than before, until he felt his UNK flesh UNK chilled by each new sound. The shapes of the men ahead of him lacked UNK as if the whip had stripped them of their very flesh. The dark forms moved like UNK on some nocturnal UNK their UNK UNK for want of vocal UNK The UNK broken trees in the valley assumed UNK UNK UNK of brush that they passed were so many UNK demons straining in anger to tear and UNK on his bones.

Warren thought of all the men out that night who, like himself, had left their protective ridge and- fear working at their UNK picked their way into the area beyond. From the east to the west coast of the Korean UNK was a strip of land in which UNK men were at that same moment UNK crawling through the night, sitting in UNK anticipation of any movement or sound, or shouting amidst confused rifle flashes and muzzle UNK White's arm went up and Warren raised his own.

UNK in the grass behind the brush UNK Warren looked about. The others likewise had hidden themselves in the grass and the brush. Over his shoulder he could see Prevot with the machine gun crew. Even at this short distance they were only vague shapes, setting up the machine gun on a small UNK so that it could fire above the heads of the rest of the UNK Warren eased his UNK safety off and gently, slowly UNK another clip of ammunition from one of the cloth UNK that marked the upper part of his body with an UNK This he placed within quick reach. The walk and his fears had served to UNK him and his UNK UNK cooled at the touch of the night air. Although the UNK vest fitted the upper part of his body UNK he felt no security. Figures seemed to crouch in the surrounding UNK in the distance he saw a band of men who seemed to advance and retreat even as he UNK Certain this menace was only UNK he yet stared in fascinated UNK his hand sticky against the stock of his weapon. He was aware of insistent inner UNK as if prisoners within sought release from his rigid body. UNK the glowing ivory baton of their UNK pointed at the clouds, diluting the UNK dark to a UNK light. Then the figures which held his attention became a group of shattered trees, standing like the UNK of a medieval UNK scene. Even so, he could not ease the tension of his body; the rough surface of the earth itself seemed to resist every attempt on his part to UNK UNK the unseen presence of the other men in the UNK he felt UNK united to these nine UNK sharing this pinpoint of being with him.

The patrol UNK around in back of the UNK approached it from above and dropped in suddenly with wild UNK You could hear them from our UNK There was a lot of shooting. We knew the enemy was UNK because a UNK was fired as the signal. So we hurried over. Two of our men were UNK a third was wounded. Trig and a very black colored boy from Detroit had killed or put out of action ten UNK by grenades and UNK fighting. When we got there, Trig and the Negro were quarreling over possession of a gold UNK around the neck of a wounded UNK The colored boy had it, and Trig UNK at him with a knife and said, UNK that to me, you black UNK We don't UNK UNK to walk on the same sidewalk with white men where I come UNK "The Negro got a bad slice on his chest from the knife UNK "What did the Colonel do about the UNK Jane asked in her UNK interested way. Mickie laughed. "He recommended both of them for the UNK and the Detroit fellow for the UNK UNK too, for a UNK UNK So you see Mr& UNK knows what it's all about. But not Jeff UNK When he was in the war, he was in Law or UNK or something like that, and an old UNK of his told me he would come down on Sundays to the Pentagon and read the UNK for UNK just like the one we sent in for UNK and go away with a real UNK These were heroes nine feet tall to him". ## Jefferson Lawrence was alone at the small, perfectly appointed table by the window looking out over the river. He had dinner and sat there over his coffee watching the winding pattern of traffic as it crossed the bridge and spread out like a UNK with two heads. Open beside him was UNK UNK He thought how this UNK fragile older woman threading her way through the streets of Westminster on a day in June, enjoying the flowers in the shops, the greetings from old friends, but never really drawing a deep, passionate breath, was so like himself. He, and Mrs& UNK too, had never permitted themselves the luxury of joys that dug into the bone marrow of the spirit. He had not because he was both poor and ambitious. UNK imposes a kind of UNK on the ambitious. They cannot stop to grasp and embrace and sit in the back seat of cars along a dark country lane. No, they must look the other way and climb one more painful step up the UNK He made the decision with his eyes open, or so he thought. At any cost, he must leave the dreary Pennsylvania mining town where his father was a UNK And so he had, so he had. At State College, he had no time to walk among the UNK on the water's edge. From his room he could look out in springtime and see the couples hand in hand walking slowly, UNK across the campus, and he could smell the sweet UNK UNK He was not UNK He was not UNK He had to teach himself patiently that these traps were not for him. He must mentally pull the UNK and close the window, so that all that existed was in the books before him. At law school, the same. More of this stamping down of human emotion as a young lawyer in New York. By the time he was prosperous UNK his goals were UNK he was UNK and afraid of women. The only one who would have him was his UNK the strange unhappy woman who became his wife. Perhaps it was right; perhaps it was UNK He had dared to defy nature, to turn his back to the UNK and he was punished. Like Mrs& UNK with her UNK about Peter UNK he had his moments of melancholy over a youth too well UNK If he had had a son, he would tell him, UNK ye UNK while ye may **h This same flower that smiles today tomorrow will be UNK But then his son could afford it. Lawrence was waiting for Bill UNK The Vice President had called and asked if he could see the Secretary at his home. He said the matter was urgent. The Secretary was uneasy about the visit. He did not like UNK He suspected something UNK and UNK about him. Lawrence could not put his finger on it precisely, and this worried him. When you disliked or UNK a man, you should have a reason. Human nature was not a piece of meat you could tell was bad by its smell. Lawrence stared a minute at the lighted ribbon of traffic, hoping that a clue to his dislike of the Vice President would appear. It did not. Therefore, he decided he was unfair to the young man and should make an effort to understand and sympathize with his point of view. A half hour later the Vice President UNK He looked very carefully at every piece of UNK as though hoping to store this information carefully in his mind. He observed the Florentine vase in the hall, the UNK painting in the library, as well as the long shelves of UNK UNK the pattern of the Oriental UNK the delicate UNK UNK He said to the Secretary, "I understand you came from a little Pennsylvania town near UNK How did you find out about this"? He waved his arm around at the UNK It was not a UNK question, Lawrence decided. This young man had so little time to learn he had to be UNK he had to find out. The Secretary did not tell him at what cost, at what UNK he learned these things. He merely said, UNK good decorator these days can make you a UNK home". The Vice President said, "If you hear of any names that would fix me cheap in return for advertising they decorated the Vice President's home, let me know. I can do business with that kind". Again, Lawrence thought a little UNK these were the fees of poverty and ambition. UNK did not have the chance to grow up UNK He had to acquire everything he was going to get in four years. They had brandy in the library. UNK looked at Lawrence with a searching glance, the kind that a UNK attorney would give a man on trial. What are your UNK Where will you UNK How best to destroy your UNK The Vice President said with a slight UNK "There isn't anyone who loves the President more than I do. Old UNK is my ideal. At the same time, you have to face facts and realize that a man who's been in the Marine Corps all his life doesn't understand much about politics. What does a monk know about UNK Lawrence listened with the UNK UNK calm of the lawyer, but his face was in the UNK UNK we have to protect the old man for his own good. You see what I mean. Congress is full of politicians, and if you want to get along with them, you have to be politic. This is why I say we just can't go ahead and UNK the Germans and pull down our own UNK Let me tell you what happened to me today. A fellow came up to me, a UNK I don't have to tell you his name, and he told me, 'I love the President like a brother, but God damn it, he's UNK me. I've got a quarter of a million Germans in my state, and those UNK tune in on Father UNK every night, and if he tells them to go out and UNK in the public square, that's what they do. He's telling them now to write letters to their UNK opposing the disarmament of UNK And another one comes to me and he says, UNK here, there's a mill in my state employs five thousand people making uniforms for the Navy. The Bishop looked at him UNK and said "Take it or leave it"! UNK there was nothing else to do. He was caught in a machine. But UNK was not easily excited or upset and said quite UNK "Let's go and see what it's UNK UNK was about UNK miles west of Birmingham, near the Georgia border and on the UNK River, a small and dirty stream. The city was a center of UNK especially in textiles, and also because of the beauty of some of its surroundings, a residence for many owners of the great industries in north Alabama. But it had, as was usual in southern cities of this sort, a Black Bottom, a low region near the river where the Negroes UNK servants and laborers huddled together in a region with no sewage save the river, where streets and UNK were neglected and where there was much poverty and UNK Wilson came by train from Birmingham and looked the city UNK the rather pleasant white city was on the hill where the chief stores were. Beyond were industries and factories. Then they went down to Black UNK In the midst of this crowded region was the Allen African Methodist Episcopal Church. It was an old and dirty wooden structure, sadly in need of UNK But it was a UNK It had been there 50 years or more and everybody in town, black and white, knew of it. It had just suffered a UNK the final crisis in a long series of UNK For the old preacher who had been there twenty-five years was dead, and the city UNK him. He was a UNK man, once vigorous but for many years now declining in strength and ability. He was stern and UNK with his UNK but UNK and UNK with the UNK especially the rich who partly supported the church. The Deacon Board, headed by a black man named Carlson, had practically taken over as the pastor grew old, and had its way with the support of the Amen corner. The characteristic thing about this church was its Amen corner and the weekly religious UNK A knot of old UNK chiefly women, listened weekly to a UNK It began invariably in low UNK almost UNK and then gradually worked up to high, shrill appeals to God and man. And then the Amen corner took hold, UNK a form of group participation in worship that stemmed from years before the Greek chorus, spreading down through the African forest, overseas to the West Indies, and then here in Alabama. With shout and slow dance, with tears and song, with scream and UNK the corner group was beset by hysteria and UNK UNK shouting, possession of something that seemed like an alien and outside force. It spread to most of the audience and was often viewed by visiting whites who UNK behind UNK and afterward discussed Negro religion. It sometimes ended in UNK UNK with many lying exhausted and panting on chair and floor. To most of those who composed the Amen corner it was a magnificent and beautiful experience, something for which they lived from week to week. It was often UNK in less wild form at the Wednesday night prayer meeting. Wilson, on his first Sunday, witnessed this with something like UNK He had preached a short sermon, trying to talk UNK to the audience, to tell them who he was, what he had done in Macon and Birmingham, and what he proposed to do here. He UNK with them on the loss of their old pastor. But then, at mention of that name, the Amen corner broke UNK He had no chance to say another word. At the very end, when the audience was silent and UNK a collection was taken and then slowly everyone filed out. The audience did not think much of the new pastor, and what the new pastor thought of the audience he did not dare at the time to say. During the next weeks he looked over the situation. First of all there was the UNK an utterly impossible place for civilized people to live in, originally poorly UNK apparently not repaired for years, with no plumbing or UNK with UNK and UNK It was arranged that he would board in the home of one of the old members of the church, a woman named Catt who, as Wilson afterward found, was briefly referred to as The UNK because of her sharp tongue and fierce UNK Ann Catt was a UNK devoted soul, never married, conducting a UNK home and devoted to her church, but a perpetual UNK and born UNK She UNK over the new pastor like an UNK UNK lest he stray from the path and not know all the truth and gossip of which she was chief UNK Then Wilson looked over the church and studied its condition. The salary of the pastor had for years been $500 annually and even this was in UNK Wilson made up his mind that he must receive at least UNK but when he mentioned this to the UNK they said nothing. The church itself must be UNK It was dirty and neglected. It really ought to be UNK and he determined to go up and talk to the city banks about this. Meanwhile, the city itself should be talked to. The streets in the colored section were UNK There was UNK and UNK The children had nowhere to go and no place to play, not even UNK The school was small, dark and UNK The teacher was a UNK UNK There were two liquor saloons not very far from the church, one white, that is conducted for white people with a side entrance for UNK the other exclusively UNK UNK there was a good deal of gambling in both. On the other side of the church was a quiet, well-kept house with shutters and recently UNK Wilson inquired about it. It was called Kent House. The UNK of the church, Carlson, was its UNK One of the leading members of the Amen corner was UNK there were two or three colored maids employed there. Wilson was told that it was a sort of hotel for white people, which seemed to him rather UNK Why should a white hotel be set down in the center of Black UNK But nevertheless it looked UNK He was glad to have it there. The rest of Black UNK was a rabbit UNK of homes in every condition of neglect, UNK and careful UNK UNK carefully repaired huts, and nicely painted and ornamented UNK were UNK together cheek by UNK with little distinction. The best could not escape from the worst and the worst UNK UNK beside the better. The yards, front and back, were UNK some were UNK UNK some had flower gardens. Behind were UNK for there was no sewage system. After looking about a bit, Wilson discovered beyond Black Bottom, across the river and far removed from the white city, a considerable tract of land, and it occurred to him that the church and the better Negro homes might gradually be moved to this UNK He talked about it to the Presiding UNK The Presiding Elder looked him over rather carefully. He was not sure what kind of a man he had in hand. But there was one thing that he had to stress, and that was that the contribution to the general church UNK the dollar money, had been seriously falling behind in this church, and that must be looked after immediately. In fact, he intimated clearly that that was the reason that Wilson had been sent UNK to make a larger contribution of dollar money. Wilson stressed the fact that clear as this was, they must have a better church, a more UNK conduct of the church organization, and an effort to get this religious center out of its UNK of wild worship into a modern church organization. He emphasized to the Presiding Elder the plan of giving up the old church and moving across the river. The Presiding Elder was sure that that would be impossible. But he told Wilson to "go ahead and UNK And Wilson tried. It did seem impossible. The bank which held the mortgage on the old church declared that the interest was considerably in UNK and the real estate people said flatly that the land across the river was being held for an eventual development for white working people who were coming in, and that none would be sold to colored UNK When it was proposed to rebuild the church, Wilson found that the terms for a new mortgage were very high. He was sure that he could do better if he went to Atlanta to get the deal UNK But when this proposal was made to his Deacon Board, he met unanimous opposition. The church certainly would not be removed. The very proposition was UNK It had been here fifty years. It was going to stay forever. It was hardly possible to get any argument on the subject. As for UNK well, that might be looked UNK but there was no UNK no hurry at all. Wilson again went downtown to a different UNK an intelligent young white man who seemed rather sympathetic, but he shook his head. UNK he said, "I think you don't quite understand the situation here. Don't you see the amount of money that has been invested by whites around that UNK UNK stores, UNK some UNK I hope not too much. The colored people are getting employment at Kent House and other places, and they are near their places of employment. When a city has arranged things like this you cannot easily change them. Now, if I were you I would just plan to repair the old church so it would last for five or ten years. By that time, perhaps something better can be UNK Then Wilson asked, "What about this Kent House which you UNK I don't understand why a white hotel should be down here". The young UNK looked at him with a certain surprise, and then he said UNK "I'm afraid I can't tell you anything in particular about Kent House. You'll have to find out about it on your own. Hope to see you again". And he dismissed the colored pastor. It was next day that UNK came and sat beside him and took his hand. She said, "My dear, do you know what Kent House UNK "No", said Wilson, "I UNK I was just asking about it. What is it"? "It's a house of prostitution for white men with white girls as UNK They hire a good deal of local labor, including two members of our UNK Board. They buy some supplies from our colored UNK and they are UNK by some of the best white gentlemen in town". Wilson stared at her. "My dear, you must be UNK UNK to Mrs& UNK she said. And after Wilson had talked to Mrs& Catt and to others, he was absolutely UNK This, of course, was the sort of thing that used to take place in Southern cities- putting white houses of prostitution with colored girls in colored neighborhoods and carrying them on openly. But it had largely disappeared on account of protest by the whites and through growing resentment on the part of the Negroes as they became more educated and got better wages. But this situation of Kent House was more UNK The wages involved were larger and more UNK The UNK were white and from out of town, avoiding local UNK The backing from the white town was greater and there was little publicity. Good wages, patronage and subscription of various kinds stopped open protest from Negroes. And yet Wilson knew that this place must go or he must go. And for him to leave this job now without accomplishing anything would mean practically the end of his career in the Methodist church, if not in all churches. Payne UNK in Madison Place and handed the reins to UNK There was a fog, which increased the darkness of the night. Two gas UNK were no more than a misleading UNK He might have been anywhere or nowhere. The pretence was that he was delivering a UNK from Dr& UNK Secretary of State Seward was a sick man. The idea had come from UNK who had once been a UNK clerk. The sick were always receiving UNK No one would question such an UNK The bottle was filled up with flour. Before Payne loomed the Old UNK Seward's home, where Key had once been killed. Now it would have another death. From the outside it was an ordinary enough house of the UNK He UNK heavily up the UNK and rang the bell. Like the UNK at UNK the UNK was pitched too high. It was still Good Friday, after all. A nigger boy opened the door. Payne did not notice him. He was thinking chiefly of UNK If their schedules were to UNK there was no point in wasting time. He pushed his way inside. For a moment the hall confused him. This was the largest house he had ever been in, almost the largest building, except for a hotel. He had no idea where Seward's room would be. In the half darkness the UNK UNK and the hall seemed enormous. Above him somewhere were the UNK Seward would be up there. He explained his UNK but without UNK much to make it UNK for he felt something well up in him which was the reason why he had fled the army. He did not really want to UNK but as in the sexual act, there was a moment when the impulse took over and could not be UNK even while you watched yourself giving way to it. He was no longer worried. Everything would be all right. He knew that in this mood he could not be stopped. Still, the sensation always surprised him. It was a thrill he felt no part in. He could only watch with a sort of gentle UNK while his body did these UNK UNK and efficient things. He brushed by the idiotic boy and UNK heavily up the stairs. They were UNK but made for UNK and UNK UNK not the great UNK he UNK The sound of his UNK was like a muffled UNK At the top of the stairs he ran into somebody standing there UNK in a dressing gown. He stopped and UNK his UNK Young Frederick Seward held out his hand. UNK a little, Payne shook his head. Dr& UNK had told him to deliver his package in person. Frederick Seward said his father was UNK and then went through a UNK at his father's door, to prove the statement. "Very well", Payne said. "I will go". He UNK but now that he knew where the elder Seward was, he did not intend to go. He pulled out his pistol and fired it. It made no sound. It had UNK UNK it, he smashed the butt down on Frederick Seward's head, over and over again. It was the first blow that was always difficult. After that, violence was UNK easy. He got caught up into it and became a different person. Only afterwards did an act like that become UNK so that he would puzzle over it for days, whereas at the time it had seemed quite real. The nigger boy fled down the stairs, screaming, UNK It was not murder at all. Payne was more methodical than that. He was merely clearing a way to what he had to do. He ran for the sick room, found his pistol was UNK and threw it away. A knife would do. From childhood he had known all about UNK Someone blocked the door from inside. He smashed it in and tumbled into darkness. He saw only dimly moving figures, but when he slashed them they UNK and fled. He went for the bed, jumped on it, and struck where he could, UNK It was like finally getting into one's own UNK to UNK one's dreams. Two men pulled him off. Nobody said anything. Payne UNK at their arms. There was a lady there, in a UNK He would not have wanted to hurt a lady. Another man UNK this one fully UNK When the knife went into his chest, he went down at once. "I'm UNK shouted UNK as he ran out into the hall. "I'm UNK and only wished he had been. That would have made things so much easier. But he was not mad. He was only UNK He UNK down the stairs and out of the door. Somewhere in the fog, the nigger boy was still yelling murder. One always UNK up, even from one's own dreams. The UNK air revived him. UNK he saw, had fled. Well, one did not expect much of people like UNK He UNK his horse, walked it away, mounted, and spurred it on. The nigger boy was close behind him. Then the nigger boy turned back and he was alone. He rode on and on. He had no idea where he was. After some time he came to an open field. An open field was better than a building, that was for sure, so he dismounted, turned off the horse, and plunged through the grass. He felt curiously UNK the world seemed far away; he knew he should get to UNK but he didn't know how. He was sure, for he had done as he was told, hadn't UNK Cap would find him and take care of him. So choosing a good tree, he clambered up into it, found a comfortable UNK and UNK up in it to sleep, like the UNK bear he was, with his hands across his chest, as though UNK with honey. UNK always made him tired, but he was not UNK ## In Boston, Edwin Booth was winding up a performance of <A New Way to UNK Old UNK It was a part so familiar to him that he did not bother to think about it any more. Acting UNK him. On a stage he always knew what to do, and tonight, to judge by the applause, he must be doing it better than usual. As Sir Giles UNK UNK often had he had to play that part, who did not believe a word of UNK he raised his arm and UNK "Where is my UNK now"? That was one of the high spots of the play. The audience, as usual, loved it. He was delighted to see them so happy. If he had any UNK it was only the small ones, about Mother in New York, and his daughter UNK and what she might be doing at this hour, with her UNK Asia, in Philadelphia. Everyone is ambivalent about his profession, if he has UNK it long enough, but there were still moments when he loved the stage and all those unseen people out there, who might cheer you or UNK you, but that was UNK though not UNK up to you. They made the world seem friendly somehow, though he knew it was not. UNK UNK was quite right about one thing. Laura Keene had been in the green room. The UNK had brought her into the wings. Since she could not act, one part suited her as well as any other, and so she was the first person to offer Mr& Lincoln a glass of water, holding it up to the box, high above her head, to Miss Harris, who had asked for it. She had been one of the first to collect her wits. It was not so much that the shot had stunned the audience, as that they had been stunned UNK Most of them had seen UNK American UNK before, and unless Miss Keene was on stage, there was not much to it. The theatre was hot and they were drugged with boredom. The stage had been UNK except for Harry UNK doing his star UNK The audience was fond of Harry UNK he was a dear, in or out of character, but he was not particularly UNK At the end of the UNK the audience would UNK Meanwhile it looked at the scenery. "Well, I guess I know enough to turn you inside out, you UNK old UNK said UNK otherwise UNK There was always a pause here, before the next line. That was when the gun went off. Yet even that explosion did not mean much. UNK were going off all over Washington City these days, because of the UNK and the theatre was not UNK Then the audience saw a small, dim figure appear at the edge of the Presidential box. UNK UNK UNK it said UNK Booth had delivered his line. Behind him UNK a small UNK cloud of smoke. They UNK forward. They had not heard what had been said. They had been sitting too long to be able to stand up easily. The figure UNK from the box, almost lost its balance, the flag draped there tore in the air, the figure landed on its left leg, fell on its hands, and pressed itself up. Harry Hawk still had his arm raised towards the wings. His speech UNK He did not lower his arm. The figure was so UNK UNK that it was as though a character from some other play had UNK into this one. The play for Saturday night was to be a benefit performance of <The UNK This figure looked like the slave dealer from that. But it also looked like a UNK hopping away from the light. There was something UNK and crazy about its motion that disturbed them. Then it disappeared into the wings. Harry Hawk had not shifted position, but he at last lowered his arm. Mrs& Lincoln UNK There was no UNK that UNK It was what anyone who had ever seen her had always expected her to do. Yet this scream had a different note in it. That absence of an urgent UNK dashed them awake like a pail of water. Clara Harris, one of the guests in the box, stood up and demanded water. Her action was UNK When something unexpected happened, one always asked for water if one were a woman, brandy if one were a man. Mrs& UNK screamed again. In the Presidential box someone leaned over the UNK and UNK "He has shot the UNK That got everybody up. On the stage, Harry Hawk began to weep. Laura Keene brushed by him with the glass of water. The crowd began to move. In Washington City everyone lived in a bubble of UNK and one death might attract another. It was not exactly panic they gave way to, but they could not just sit there. The UNK UNK for no one could bear silence, UNK out the sound of Mrs& Lincoln's UNK At the rear of the UNK UNK some men tried to push open the door to the box corridor. It would not give. A Dr& Charles UNK clambered up on the stage and got the actors to UNK him up to the box. In the audience a man named UNK lost his head and tried to rescue a little girl from the UNK on the same principle which had led Miss Harris to demand water. Someone opened the corridor door from the inside, and called for a UNK Somehow Dr& Charles UNK was forced through the mob and squeezed out into the UNK corridor. He went straight to the Presidential box. As usual, Mrs& Lincoln had lost her head, but nobody blamed her for doing so now. There was a little blood on the UNK of her dress, for the UNK had slashed Miss UNK UNK Major UNK with a knife. UNK said he was bleeding to death. By the look of him he wasn't that far gone. With a UNK the man spread his legs and, a third time, confronted them. Once more, Katie reared, and UNK in fear. For a moment, boy and mount hung in UNK Stevie twisted and, UNK commanded the mare to leap straight ahead. But the stranger was UNK still. With a bold arm, he dared once more to obstruct them. Katie reared a third time, then, trembling, UNK The stranger UNK UNK the UNK he UNK with all his might and forced Katie to her knees. It was absurd. Stevie could feel himself UNK He saw the ground coming up- and the UNK head. With incredible UNK he brought his fists together and UNK The blow encountered UNK hair and hard bone. The man uttered a weird cry, spun about, and collapsed in the sand. Katie UNK to her feet, Stevie UNK retaining his seat. Again Katie reared, and now, UNK he compelled her to bring her UNK down again and again upon the sprawled figure of the stranger. He could feel his own feet, UNK striking repeatedly until the body was UNK He UNK and his lips UNK He heard himself UNK They rode around and around to UNK the figure into the sand. Only the top of the head, with a spot bare and white as a UNK remained visible. Stevie was shouting UNK A train UNK UNK he UNK They were pursuing him. He was UNK his fists UNK so tightly that his knuckles UNK Then Katie UNK and again he was falling, UNK UNK UNK His mother was UNK him, but he was still falling. His head hung over the boards of UNK UNK before it was sprawled the UNK UNK of the bearded stranger. UNK wake up now! UNK nearly there". He had been UNK He was safe in his UNK arms. The train had UNK UNK UNK as the cars rolled beside a little UNK UNK UNK the UNK called. He came by and UNK UNK UNK #CHAPTER UNK UNK UNK startled him awake.

He couldn't make out what he was saying. No doubt it had to do with the UNK Why should he be UNK Rousseau is so persuasive that Voltaire is almost convinced that he should burn his books, too. But while the two men are riding into the country, where they are going to dinner, they are attacked in the dark of the forest by a band of UNK who strip them of everything, including most of their clothes. "You must be a very learned man", says Voltaire to one of the UNK "A learned UNK the UNK laughs in his face. But Voltaire UNK He goes to the chief himself. "At what university did you UNK he UNK He refuses to believe that the UNK chief never attended a higher institution. "To have become so UNK he says, UNK you must have studied many arts and UNK The UNK annoyed by these questions, UNK Voltaire down and UNK at him that he not only never went to any school, but never even learned how to read. When finally the two UNK men reach their UNK home, UNK fears are once again UNK For it is such a distinguished place, with such fine works of art and such a big library, that there can be little doubt but that the owner has become UNK by all this culture. To UNK surprise, however, their host gives them fresh clothes to put on, opens his purse to lend them money and sits them down before a good dinner. Immediately after dinner, however, Rousseau asks for still another favor. Could he have pen and paper, UNK He is in a hurry to write another essay against culture. Such was the impromptu that Voltaire gave to UNK of laughter at UNK UNK and that was soon circulated in manuscript throughout the literary circles of Europe, to be printed sometime later, but with the name of UNK of UNK the famous UNK substituted for that of UNK How UNK But at the same time how understandable. How could the rich, for whom life was made so simple, ever understand the UNK the UNK the UNK the errors, sins and even crimes to which the poor were driven in their efforts to overcome the great advantages the rich had in the race of life? How, for example, could a Voltaire understand the strange UNK in which a Rousseau would find himself when, soon after the furor of his first UNK he acquired still another title to UNK This time as a musician. As a composer. Ever since he had first begun to study music and to teach it, Rousseau had dreamed of UNK through to fame as the result of a successful opera. But his facility in this UNK was not great. And his efforts to get a performance for his UNK UNK invariably failed. And for good reasons. His operatic music had little merit. But then one day, while on a week's visit to the country home of a retired Swiss UNK Rousseau amused the company with a few little melodies he had written, to which he attached no great importance. He was really amazed to discover the other guests so excited about these delicate little songs. UNK a few such songs UNK they urged him. UNK them onto some sort of little plot, and you'll have a delightful UNK He didn't believe them. UNK he said. "This is the sort of stuff I write and then throw UNK "Heaven UNK cried the ladies, UNK by his music. "You must make an opera out of this UNK And they wouldn't leave off arguing and pleading until he had UNK Oh, the irony and the bitterness of it! That after all his years of effort to become a composer, he should now, now when he was still UNK UNK to the critics of his UNK on the Arts and UNK be so close to a success in music and have to reject it. Or at least appear to reject it! But what else could he do? You couldn't on the one hand UNK the arts and at the same time practice them, could you? Well, yes, perhaps in literature, since you could argue that you couldn't keep silent about your feelings against literature and so were involved in spite of yourself. But now music UNK No. That would be too UNK And the fault, of course, was UNK The fault was Rameau's and that of the whole culture of this UNK age. For it was Rameau's type of music that he had been trying to write, and that he couldn't write. These little songs, however, were sweet UNK from the heart, tender memories of his childhood, little melodies that anyone could UNK and that would make one want to weep. But no. He couldn't appear as a composer now. That UNK UNK for so long, was now forbidden to him. Still, just for the ladies, and just for this once, for this one weekend in the country, he would make a little piece out of his UNK The ladies were delighted and Jean Jacques was UNK And everyone went to work to learn the parts which he wrote. But then, after the little UNK had been given its feeble amateur UNK everyone insisted that it was too good to be lost UNK and that the Royal Academy of Music must now have the manuscript in order to give it the really first-rate performance it UNK Rousseau was aware that he must seem like a UNK standing there and arguing that he could not possibly permit a public performance. The ladies especially couldn't understand what troubled him. A UNK UNK what was a contradiction in one's life? Every woman has had the experience of saying no when she meant yes, and saying UNK when she meant no. Rousseau had to admit that though he couldn't agree to a public performance, he would indeed, just for his own private satisfaction, UNK love to know how his work would sound when done by professional musicians and by trained voices. "I'd simply like to know if it is as good as you kind people seem to UNK he said. UNK the historian, pointed out to Jean Jacques that this was impossible. The musicians of the Royal Opera would not UNK a work merely to see how it would sound. UNK to satisfy the author's curiosity. Rousseau agreed. But he recalled that UNK had once had a private performance of his opera UNK behind closed UNK just for himself alone. Duclos understood what was UNK UNK that the writer of the UNK of UNK should now become known as the writer of an amusing little UNK That would certainly be UNK But Duclos thought he saw a way out. "Let me do the submitting to the Royal UNK he suggested. "Your name will never appear. No one will even suspect that it is your work". To that Rousseau could UNK But now what crazy twists and turns of his UNK UNK at one and the same time that his work might be turned down- which would be a blow to his pride even though no one knew he was the UNK and that the work would be accepted, and then that his violent feelings in the matter would certainly UNK how deeply concerned he was in spite of himself. And how anxious this lover of UNK was for UNK And thus torn between his desire to be known as the composer of a successful opera and the necessity of remaining true to his proclaimed desire for UNK Rousseau suffered through several painful weeks. All these emotions were screwed up to new heights when, after acceptance and the first UNK there UNK such a UNK of excitement among UNK music lovers that Duclos had to come running to Rousseau to inform him that the news had reached the superintendent of the King's UNK and that he was now demanding that the work be offered first at the royal summer palace of UNK Imagine the honor of it! "What was your UNK Jean Jacques asked, striving to appear UNK "I UNK Duclos said. "What else could I do? Monsieur de UNK was UNK of course. But I said I would first have to get the author's UNK And I was certain he would UNK How UNK all this UNK Why had not this success come to him before he had plunged into his UNK and before he had committed himself to a life of UNK and UNK Now, when everything was opening up to him- even the court of Louis UNK he had to play a role of UNK Back and forth Duclos had to go, between M& de UNK and Jean Jacques and between the Duke UNK and Jean Jacques again, as his little UNK <The Village UNK though still UNK took on ever more importance. And of course the news of who the composer was did finally begin to get around among his closest friends. But they, naturally, kept his secret well, and the public at large knew only of a great excitement in musical and court circles. How UNK it was to go among people who did not know him as the composer, but who talked in the most glowing terms of the promise of the piece after having heard the first UNK The furor was such that people who could not possibly have UNK their way into the UNK were pretending that they were intimate with the whole affair and that it would be UNK And listening to such a conversation one morning while taking a cup of chocolate in a UNK Rousseau found himself bathed in UNK trembling lest his authorship become known, and at the same time dreaming of the startling effect he would make if he should proclaim himself suddenly as the composer. He felt himself now, as he himself says in his UNK at a crucial point of his life. And that was why, on the day of the performance, when a carriage from the royal UNK called to take him to the palace, he did not bother to UNK On the contrary, he was pleased that his face showed a neglect of several days. Seeing him in that condition, and about to enter the hall where the King, the UNK the whole royal family and all the members of the highest aristocracy would be present, UNK and the UNK UNK and others tried to stop him. "You can't go in that UNK they UNK "Why UNK Jean Jacques asked. "Who is going to stop me"? "You haven't dressed for the UNK they pointed out to him. "I'm dressed as I always am", Rousseau said. UNK better nor UNK "At home, UNK they UNK "But here you are in the palace. There's the UNK And UNK de UNK "If they are here, then surely I have the right to be here", Rousseau said. "And even more right. Since I am the UNK "But in such a slovenly UNK "What is slovenly about me"? Rousseau asked. "Is it because of my UNK that hair grows on my UNK Surely it would grow there whether I washed myself or not. A hundred years ago I would have worn a beard with UNK And those without UNK would have stood out as not dressed for the occasion. Now times have changed, and I must pretend that hair doesn't grow on my face. That's the fashion. And fashion is the real king here. Not Louis UNK since even he UNK Now, if you don't mind, I should like to hear my own piece UNK But of course behind his UNK he didn't feel bold at all. He UNK lest his piece should fail. And this in addition to his usual fear of being among people of high society. His fear of making some UNK or inappropriate remark. And even deeper than that: his fear lest in this closed hall he should suddenly itch to relieve himself. Could he walk out in the midst of his UNK Here, before the UNK Before the UNK It was the first time any of us had laughed since the morning began. ## The rider from Concord was as good as his word. He came UNK and UNK down the road, his horse kicking up clouds of dust, UNK UNK UNK By God, they're UNK they UNK We heard him before he ever showed, and we heard him yelling after he was out of sight. UNK Chandler hadn't UNK the strength of his UNK not at all. I think you could have heard him a mile away, and he was bursting at every seam with importance. I have observed that being up on a horse changes the whole character of a man, and when a very small man is up on a saddle, he'd like as not prefer to eat his meals there. That's UNK and I appreciate the sentiment. As for this rider, I never saw him before or afterwards and never saw him dismounted, so whether he stood tall or short in his shoes, I can't UNK but I do know that he gave the day tone and distinction. The last thing in the world that resembled a war was our line of farmers and UNK and mechanics perched on top of a stone wall, and this UNK rider made us feel a good deal UNK and more alert to the situation. We came down off the wall as if he had UNK all of us, and we crouched behind it. I have heard people talk with contempt about the British UNK but that only proves that a lot of people talk about things of which they are UNK UNK Whatever we felt about the UNK we respected them in terms of their trade, which was UNK and I know that I, myself, was UNK with apprehension and fear and that my hands were soaking wet where they held my gun. I wanted to wipe my UNK but I didn't dare to, the state my hands were in, just as I didn't dare to do anything about the UNK The gun would fire or not, just as chance UNK I put a lot more trust in my two legs than in the gun, because the most important thing I had learned about war was that you could run away and survive to talk about it. The UNK which was so near that it seemed just a piece up the road now, stopped for long enough to count to twenty; and in that brief UNK a redcoat officer came tearing down the road, whipping his horse fit to UNK I don't know whether he was after our rider, who had gone by a minute before, or whether he was simply scouting conditions; but when he passed us by, a musket UNK and he reared his horse, swung it around, and began to whip it back in the direction from which he had come. He was a fine and UNK rider, but his skill was wasted on us. From above me and somewhere behind me, a rifle UNK The redcoat officer collapsed like a UNK UNK and the horse reared and threw him from the saddle, except that one UNK foot caught in the UNK Half UNK by the weight UNK the dust, and the heat, the horse leaped our wall, UNK out the UNK brains against it, and leaving him lying there among us- while the horse crashed away through the brush. It was my initiation to war and the insane symphony war UNK for what had happened on the common was only terror and UNK but this UNK broken head, not ten feet away from me, was the sharp definition of what my reality had become. And now the redcoats were coming, and the UNK was a part of the dust cloud on the road to the west of us. I must state that the faster things happened, the slower they happened; the passage and rhythm of time changed, and when I remember back to what happened then, each event is a separate and frozen incident. In my recollection, there was a long interval between the death of the officer and the appearance of the first of the retreating UNK and in that interval the dust cloud over the road seems to hover UNK Yet it could not have been more than a matter of seconds, and then the front of the British army came into view. It was only hours since I had last seen them, but they had changed and I had changed. In the very front rank, two men were wounded and staggered along, trailing blood behind them. No UNK here, no UNK and the red coats were covered with a fine film of dust. They marched with bayonets fixed, and as fixed on their faces was anger, fear, and UNK UNK after rank of them came down the road, and the faces were all the same, and they walked in a sea of dust. UNK hold your UNK UNK your UNK a voice called, and what made it even more terrible and unreal was that the redcoat ranks never paused for an instant, only some of them UNK toward the stone wall, from behind which the voice came. The front of their column had already passed us, when another officer came riding down the side of the road, not five paces from where we were. My Cousin Simmons carried a UNK but he had loaded it with bird shot, and as the officer came opposite him, he rose up behind the wall and UNK One moment there was a man in the UNK the next a UNK horror on a horse that bolted through the redcoat ranks, and during the next second or two, we all of us fired into the suddenly disorganized column of soldiers. One moment, the road was filled with disciplined troops, marching four by four with a purpose as UNK as death; the next, a cloud of gun smoke covered a screaming fury of sound, out of which the redcoat soldiers emerged with their bayonets and their cursing UNK In the course of this, they had fired on us; but I have no memory of that. I had squeezed the trigger of my own gun, and to my amazement, it had fired and kicked back into my shoulder with the force of an angry UNK and then I was adding my own voice to the UNK of sound, UNK more vile language than I ever thought I knew, UNK and shouting, and aware that if I had passed water before, it was not enough, for my UNK were soaking wet. I would have stood there and died there if left to myself, but Cousin Simmons grabbed my arm in his UNK grip and fairly UNK me out of there; and then I came to some sanity and plunged away with such extraordinary speed that I UNK Cousin Simmons by far. Everyone else was UNK Later we realized that the redcoats had stopped their charge at the wall. Their only hope of survival was to hold to the road and keep UNK ## We tumbled to a stop in Deacon UNK cow hole, a UNK bit of pasture with a muddy pool of water in its UNK A dozen cows UNK sadly and regarded us as if we were UNK as perhaps we were at that moment, with the crazy excitement of our first UNK the yelling and shooting still continuing up at the road, and the UNK of some of the men, which was so great that they UNK into the muddy water and UNK up UNK of it. Isaac UNK one of the men from Lincoln, had taken a musket ball in his UNK and though he had found the strength to run with us, now he collapsed and lay on the ground, UNK the Reverend holding his head and wiping his hot UNK It may appear that we were cruel and UNK but no one had time to spend UNK with poor UNK except the UNK I know that I myself felt that it was a mortal shame for a man to be torn open by a British musket ball, as Isaac had been, yet I also felt relieved and lucky that it had been him and not myself. I was drunk with excitement and the smell of UNK that came floating down from the road, and the fact that I was not afraid now, but only waiting to know what to do next. Meanwhile, I UNK my gun, as the other men were doing. We were less than a quarter of a mile from the road, and we could trace its shape from the ribbon of powder smoke and dust that hung over it. Wherever you UNK you saw UNK running across the UNK some away from the road, some toward it, some parallel to it; and about a mile to the west a cluster of at least fifty militia were making their way in our direction. Cousin Joshua and some others felt that we should march toward UNK and take up new positions ahead of the UNK British column, but another group maintained that we should stick to this spot and this section of road. I didn't offer any advice, but I certainly did not want to go back to where the officer lay with his brains dashed out. Someone said that while we were standing here and arguing about it, the British would be UNK but Cousin Simmons said he had watched them marching west early in the morning, and moving at a much UNK pace it had still taken half an hour for their column to pass, what with the UNK of the road and their baggage and ammunition UNK While this was being UNK we saw the militia to the west of us fanning out and breaking into little clusters of two and three men as they approached the road. It was the opinion of some of us that these must be part of the UNK who had been in the Battle of the North Bridge, which entitled them to a sort of veteran status, and we felt that if they employed this UNK it was likely enough the best one. UNK Dover said: "It makes sense. If we cluster together, the redcoats can make an advantage out of it, but there's not a blessed thing they can do with two or three of us except chase us, and we can outrun them". That settled it, and we broke into parties of two and three. Cousin Joshua Dover decided to remain with the Reverend and poor Isaac UNK until life passed away- and he was hurt so badly he did not seem for long in this world. I went off with Cousin UNK who maintained that if he didn't see to me, he didn't know who would. "Good UNK UNK he said, "I thought one thing you'd have no trouble learning is when to get out of a UNK "I learned that now", I said. ## We ran east for about half a mile before we turned back to the road, panting from the effort and soaked with UNK There was a UNK of trees that appeared to provide cover right up to the road, and the shouting and UNK never UNK Under the trees, there was a dead UNK a young boy with a UNK white skin and a face full of UNK who had taken a rifle ball directly between the eyes. Three men were around him. They had stripped him of his musket and equipment, and now they were pulling his boots and jacket off. Cousin Simmons grabbed one of them by the shoulder and flung him away. UNK name, what are you to UNK the dead with the fight going UNK Cousin Simmons UNK They tried to UNK him, but Joseph Simmons was as wide as two average men, and it would have taken UNK men than these were to UNK him. That summer the gambling houses were closed, despite the threats of Pierre UNK a UNK manufacturer. UNK was no longer permitted in the streets. The UNK and other places of prostitution were UNK The slit UNK had to go. UNK was no longer tolerated. In UNK a UNK UNK Jake UNK marched down the aisle in St& Peter's one Sunday morning, followed by one of the women from the UNK whose dress and walk plainly showed the lack of any UNK UNK themselves down on the front bench, they turned to UNK at those around them. John's first impulse was to denounce their UNK But the thought occurred that God would want this opportunity used to tell them about Him. UNK he opened the Bible and read of the woman at the well. He finished the worship service as if there had been no UNK attempt to UNK God and man. The next morning, as the clock struck nine, he appeared at the Council meeting in the Town Hall and insisted that the couple would have to be punished if the Church was to be UNK "I have told you before, and I tell you again", Monsieur Favre said UNK UNK to the preaching of the UNK John UNK in anger. "That is the answer the UNK will always make when the Church points its fingers at their sins. I say to you that the Church will ever UNK UNK John's reply was like a declaration of war. Monsieur Favre sat down in his UNK UNK lips UNK eyes UNK UNK UNK a short man with a UNK of UNK rose. Every eye was on him as he began to speak. "What Master Calvin says is true. How can we have a good city unless we respect UNK UNK UNK a tall man with UNK UNK and UNK eyes, got to his feet. "We all know that Jake Camaret and the woman are UNK living together. It would be well to show the UNK how we deal with UNK UNK UNK the son of the famous UNK UNK "Do not listen to that UNK He is UNK the liberty my father gave his life to UNK John was quietly UNK "There can be no compromise when souls are in UNK A week later the sentence of the Council was carried out: Jake Camaret and the woman were marched naked through the streets past a UNK UNK Before them stalked the UNK proclaiming as he went, UNK the Council deals with those who break its UNK UNK UNK UNK and UNK persons. Let UNK contemplate their ways, and let every man UNK ## John's thoughts raced painfully into the past as he read the letter he had just received from his sister Mary. Charles had died two weeks before, in early November, without being UNK to the Church. The UNK in a body, had tried to force him on his UNK to let them give him the last rites of the Church, but he had died still proclaiming salvation by faith. UNK had taken place at night in the ground at the public crossroads under the UNK so that his enemies could not find his body and have it dug up and burned. The UNK of St& UNK Claude de UNK had been a good friend, but not even he thought Charles deserved burial in UNK ground. John closed his eyes and saw once again the little UNK in his mother's bedroom, where she had knelt to tell the good Virgin of her needs. The UNK Virgin was still there, but no one knelt before her now. Not even UNK she, too, prayed only to God. For an instant John longed for the sound of the bells of UNK the touch of his mother's hand, the UNK of UNK voice in the square UNK rooms, his father's bass tones UNK to the UNK and the sight of the beloved UNK But he had to follow the light. Unless God expected a man to believe the Holy UNK why had He given them to him? ## The white-clad trees stood like UNK in the February night. Snow buried the streets and covered the slanting UNK as John UNK toward St& UNK A carriage UNK by, its dim lights filtering through the UNK The sharp wind UNK at him and his feet felt like ice as the snow penetrated the holes of his shoes, his only ones, now UNK with folded UNK The city had recently given him a small salary, but it was not enough to supply even UNK As he UNK the square, a round figure muffled in a long, black cape UNK by. John recognized UNK UNK and called out a UNK How grateful he was to such UNK There were several on the Council who tried to live like Christians. Despite their efforts, the problems seemed to grow UNK all the time. UNK his steps, John entered the vast church and climbed the tower steps to the UNK UNK the big one, in the silent UNK lay a dead UNK and on the smaller UNK the UNK two gray and white birds slept huddled together in the cold winter air. John leaned upon the stone UNK He brushed back his black hair, UNK it under his UNK cap to keep it from blowing in his eyes. Below the UNK world rolled away to UNK white UNK above him the deep blue sky UNK with stars. He stood very still, his arms at his sides, staring up at the UNK then down at the UNK lights below. "How long, my UNK How UNK I have never asked for an easy task, but I am weary of the UNK UNK was difficult these days. UNK plagued him. UNK headaches were UNK UNK tore through him like a physical pain whenever he thought of Peter UNK UNK Nicholas UNK Martin UNK and even the compromising Louis du UNK An occasional traveler from Italy brought news of Peter UNK who was now distributing his Bible among the UNK UNK Letters came regularly from UNK UNK and UNK He had Anthony and William to UNK in and UNK But William continued to find a bitter joy in UNK images and tearing down symbols sacred to the Old Church. John found it difficult, but he held him in UNK And Anthony was busy most of the time UNK this girl and that. His easy good looks made him a favorite with the ladies. UNK instead of becoming the City of God, as John had UNK had in the two years since he had been there, continued to be a UNK place where all manner of vice UNK UNK poured in, signing the UNK and rules in order to remain, and then UNK them. UNK UNK UNK UNK their trade, thieves UNK UNK UNK and the UNK UNK Catholics who were truly Christians longed for the simple penance of days gone by. UNK recalled the heroism of the past and UNK "Are we going to allow the Protestant Pope, Master UNK to curtail our UNK **h Why, UNK why, doesn't he stick to preaching the UNK instead of meddling in civic affairs, politics, economics, and social issues that are no concern of the UNK And John's reply was always the UNK "Anything that affects souls is the concern of the UNK We will have UNK UNK burned behind his eyes as he prayed and UNK tonight. Unless the confusion UNK he would not be coming here much longer. Monsieur UNK threat would become a reality, for he continued to proclaim loudly that the city must rid itself of "that UNK The slow tapping of a cane on the stone steps coming up to the tower interrupted his UNK UNK at first, the tapping grew until it sounded loud against the wind. UNK UNK John thought. What is he doing here at this UNK He started down the steps to meet the UNK UNK who had been one of the early UNK in Paris. UNK Is that you? I came to warn you of a UNK John stood above him, his face UNK What now? UNK like a man grown old, he took UNK hand and led him below to the tower study, guiding him to a chair beside the little UNK where a fire still burned. UNK John asked UNK "Monsieur Favre just paid me a visit. I went to your rooms, and Anthony told me you were here. Two UNK Caroli and UNK are to challenge you and William to a debate before the Council. It is to be a trap. You know the UNK if you lose the debate after accepting a UNK you will be UNK "What will be the UNK "You are to be accused of UNK to confuse the religious who remain UNK UNK and fear fused in John. Ever since the fourth century a controversy had raged over the person of Christ. Those who refused to believe that He was the eternal Son of God were termed UNK Peter Caroli had come to UNK saying that he had been a UNK of the Church of Rome and had been UNK in Paris for his UNK faith. He asked to be appointed a UNK But Michael UNK had UNK him, revealing he had never been a UNK but was an UNK afraid to state his faith, because he knew John Calvin had written a book against their belief that the soul slept after death. So John had refused to agree to his appointment as a UNK and now Caroli sought revenge. John UNK "If William agrees, we should insist on a public UNK he said at length. "There is more to the UNK UNK demands that the Lord's UNK be administered here as it used to be, with UNK bread. Furthermore, UNK decrees that we must do as we are ordered by the Council, preach only the word of God and stop meddling in UNK "It was always the spirit with UNK matters such as UNK or UNK bread are UNK Geneva must remain a sovereign state. We will not yield to the demands of UNK The UNK played over UNK flowing white locks and rugged features. "Monsieur Favre indicated that if I would UNK after you and William are UNK following the debate, I will be given a place of UNK "What was your reply to that"? "That I would rather be banished with two such Christians than be made the Chief UNK ## The following morning, as John entered the Place UNK on his way to visit a sick UNK he had a UNK of danger. Then suddenly a group of men and dogs circled him. He wanted to run, but he knew that if he did, he would be lost. He stood very still, his heart thumping wildly. On the UNK of the UNK the Camaret brothers and UNK Favre shook their fists. "Are you going to comply with the demands of UNK the UNK Jake called. UNK a rowdy with a big UNK of a nose UNK UNK John lifted his hand for silence. "Know this: the ministers will not yield to the demands of UNK His voice shook a little. UNK UNK a UNK For an instant John was UNK When he felt the side of his head, his fingers came away covered with blood. Before he could UNK another stone struck him. And another. "Let him be UNK Pierre UNK the UNK manufacturer said, his little UNK eyes UNK "We have taught him a UNK The crowd moved back and John started UNK down the hill. UNK UNK him as he staggered forward. Then he slipped and went down on his hands and knees in the melting snow. At once a bevy of dogs was snapping and UNK around him. One, more horrible than the rest, UNK UNK deep in his UNK his hair UNK With great difficulty John clambered to his feet and started to run, sweat pouring down his face. Standing in the shelter of the UNK a rejected hospital tent on which the rain now UNK no longer UNK Adam watched his own hands touch the objects on the improvised counter of boards laid across two beef UNK There was, of course, no real need to UNK everything. A quarter inch this way or that for the UNK or the UNK or the barley sugar, or the UNK or the UNK or the condensed milk, or the UNK or the UNK what could it UNK Adam watched his own hands make the UNK anxious movement that, when rain falls and nobody comes, and ruin draws close like a cat rubbing against the UNK has been the ritual of stall UNK forever. He recognized the gesture. He knew its meaning. He had seen a dry, old, UNK hand reach out, with that painful UNK to touch, to UNK to shift UNK some object worth a UNK Back in UNK he had seen that gesture, and at that sight his heart had always died within him. On such occasions he had not had the courage to look at the face above the hand, whatever face it might be. Now the face was his own. He wondered what expression, as he made that gesture, was on his face. He wondered if it wore the old anxiety, or the old, taut UNK But there was no need, he remembered, for his hand to reach out, for his face to show concern or UNK It was nothing to him if rain fell and nobody came. Then why was he assuming the UNK the gesture and the UNK What was he UNK Or was he now taking the UNK the gesture and the UNK because it was the only way to affirm his history and identity in the UNK UNK loneliness of this land. This was Virginia. He looked out of the tent at the company street. The rain UNK on the freezing UNK of the street. Beyond that misty gray of the rain, he saw the stretching UNK low diminutive log UNK UNK with mud, with UNK a man would have to crouch to get through, with UNK of UNK laid over boughs or boards from hardtack UNK or fence UNK with UNK UNK of sticks and dried mud. The chimney of the hut across from him was UNK by a beef barrel with ends knocked out. In this heavy air, however, that device did not seem to help. The smoke from that chimney rose as UNK as smoke from any other, and hung as sadly in the UNK creeping back down along the UNK canvas of the roof. Over the door was a board with large, UNK UNK HOME UNK UNK This was the hut of Simms Purdew, the hero. The men were huddled in those UNK Adam knew the names of UNK He knew the faces of all, UNK or UNK old or young, fat or thin, suffering or hardened, sad or gay, good or bad. When they stood about his tent, UNK each other, UNK their UNK cursing command or weather, he had studied their faces. He had had the need to understand what life UNK behind the UNK of flesh, behind the UNK the UNK the UNK Once UNK looking at Simms Purdew, the only man in the world whom he hated, he had seen the heavy, UNK UNK jaw open and close to UNK the UNK UNK UNK and had seen the UNK eyes go UNK with whisky and UNK and suddenly he was not seeing the face of that vile creature. He was UNK somehow, the face of a young boy, the boy Simms Purdew must once have been, a boy with UNK hair, and blue eyes dancing with UNK and the boy mouth UNK UNK among the UNK In that moment of vision Adam heard the voice within himself saying: <I must not hate him, I must not hate him or I shall UNK His heart suddenly opened to joy. He thought that if once, only once, he could talk with Simms Purdew, something about his own life, and all life, would be clear and simple. If Simms Purdew would turn to him and say: UNK you know when I was a boy, it was a funny thing happened. UNK tell you UNK If only Simms Purdew could do that, whatever the thing he remembered and told. It would be a sign for the UNK and he, Adam, would understand. Now, Adam, in the gray light of afternoon, stared across at the hut opposite his tent, and thought of Simms Purdew lying in there in the gloom, UNK on his UNK with the fumes of whisky choking the air. He saw the sign above the door of the UNK HOME UNK UNK He saw the figure of a man in a UNK coming up the company street, with an UNK of wood. It was Pullen James, the UNK of Simms UNK He carried the wood, carried the water, did the cooking, cleaning and UNK and occasionally got a kick in the butt for his UNK Adam watched the moisture flow from the UNK It gave the UNK fabric a dull UNK like metal. Pullen James humbly lowered his head, pushed aside the UNK door of the UNK and was gone from sight. Adam stared at the door and remembered that Simms Purdew had been awarded the Medal of Honor for gallantry at UNK The street was again UNK The UNK was UNK off now, but the light was UNK With enormous interest, Adam watched his hands as they touched and shifted the objects on the board directly before him. Into the UNK of the street, and his spirit, moved a form. The form was UNK in an army UNK much UNK fastened at the neck with a UNK From under the shapeless UNK of blanket the feet moved in the mud. The feet wore army shoes, in obvious UNK The head was wrapped in a UNK and on top of the UNK rode a great hamper across which a piece of UNK had been UNK The gray face stared straight ahead in the UNK UNK ran down the UNK gathered at the tip of the nose, and at the UNK The figure was close enough now for him to see the nose UNK to UNK the drop clinging there. The figure stopped and one hand was UNK freed from the hamper to scratch the nose. Then the figure moved on. This was one of the Irish women who had built their own huts down near the river. They did washing. Adam recognized this one. He recognized her because she was the one who, in a winter UNK on the edge of camp, had once stopped him and reached down her hand to touch his fly. UNK o' UNK UNK she had UNK in her soft UNK UNK o' UNK Her name was UNK They called her Mollie the UNK and laughed. Looking down the street after her, Adam saw that she had again stopped and again removed one hand from the basket. He could not make out, but he knew that again she was scratching her nose. Mollie the Mutton was scratching her nose. The words ran UNK in his UNK UNK the Mutton is scratching her nose in the UNK Then the words fell into a UNK UNK the Mutton is scratching her nose, UNK her nose in the rain. Mollie the Mutton is scratching her nose in the UNK The pattern would not stop. It came again and again. He felt trapped in that pattern, in the repetition. Suddenly he thought he might weep. UNK the matter with me"? he demanded out UNK He looked wildly around, at the now empty street, at the mud, at the rain. "Oh, what's the matter with me"? he demanded. ## When he had stored his stock in the great oak chest, locked the two big UNK and secured the additional UNK tied the fly of the tent, and picked up the cash box, he moved up the darkening street. He would UNK the cash box into the hands of UNK UNK then stand by while his employer checked the contents and the list of items UNK Then UNK Then what? He did not know. His mind closed on that UNK as though fog had descended to blot out a UNK Far off, in the dusk, he heard voices singing, muffled but strong. In one of the huts a group of men were huddled together, singing. He stopped. He UNK to hear. He heard the words: UNK of UNK UNK for me, Let me hide myself in UNK Let the water and the blood From Thy UNK side **h" He thought: <I am a Jew from UNK He was standing there, he thought, in Virginia, in the UNK dusk, in a costly UNK that had belonged to another Jew. That other Jew, a young man too, had left that UNK behind, in a rich house, and marched away. He had crossed the river which now, beyond the woods UNK was sliding UNK under the UNK He had plunged into the dark woods beyond. He had died there. What had that man, that other young Jew, felt as he stood in the UNK and heard other men, far away, singing UNK Adam thought of the UNK regiment after regiment, row after row, the thousands of huts, stretching away into the night. He thought of the men, the UNK UNK UNK in them. He thought of Simms Purdew UNK on his bunk while Pullen James crouched by the UNK UNK an UNK for UNK and a wet log UNK He thought of Simms Purdew, who once had risen at the edge of a UNK a UNK scream on his lips, and swung a UNK musket like a UNK to beat down the UNK of Rebel bayonets about him. He thought of Simms Purdew rising up, fearless in glory. He felt the UNK of pity flood through him, UNK his very flesh. Those men, lying in the huts, they did not know. They did not know who they were or know their own worth. In the pity for them his loneliness was gone. Then he thought of Aaron UNK standing in his rich house saying: "God is tired of taking the blame. He is going to let History take the blame for a UNK He thought of the old man laughing under the glitter of the great UNK He thought: UNK in my heart can I make the world hang UNK ## Adam rose from the crouch necessary to enter the UNK He saw Mose UNK by the UNK breaking up hardtack into a UNK A pot was boiling on the coals. UNK give Ole UNK all his UNK Mose asked softly. Adam UNK UNK Mose UNK UNK And look what he done give us". Adam looked at the UNK "What is it"? he asked. UNK Mose said, and UNK licked his lips.

Skopas expressed no curiosity over the case, offered no expression of sympathy, made no move to escort McFeeley to the door. All four remained UNK on the sofa until he had left. He had spoken to Mrs& Emerson the previous day. There remained a family named UNK owners of a two-story UNK house on the south side of the Andrus home. Their names had not come up in any discussions with UNK and he had no idea what they would be like.

Between the telephone and the wall plug there was sixty feet of UNK and when the conversation came to an end, Eugene carried the instrument with him the whole length of the apartment, to his bathroom, where it rang three more times while he was shaving and in the tub. Before he left the apartment he knocked on their door and asked if there was anything he could do for them. Harold shook his head. UNK called a few minutes UNK Eugene said. "She wants you and Barbara to have dinner with her tomorrow UNK He handed Harold a key to the front door, and cautioned him against leaving it unlocked while they were out of the apartment. When enough time had elapsed so that there was little likelihood of his returning for something he had forgotten, Harold went out into the hall and stood looking into one room after another. In the room next to theirs was a huge UNK of UNK UNK carved and decorated with gold UNK It was the most UNK cradle he had ever seen.

There was only one way to accomplish this: by design, by drawing diagrams and sketches in which he UNK the UNK corner of his mind for creative ideas to carry his concept.

At the landing she saw UNK her face UNK pink with UNK run down the hall from the kitchen to the front door. Juanita stopped just inside the open door, her hand to her mouth. As Kate came swiftly down the stairs to the hall she saw Colonel UNK framed in the UNK his face set in the same vulnerable look Juanita UNK Kate greeted him UNK uneasy with misgivings at his visit. "What brings you here again, Colonel UNK she asked, taking him and Juanita into the parlor where the shutters were closed against the afternoon sun. "I stopped to say UNK Mrs& UNK and to tell you how sorry I was to hear about your baby. I wish our doctor could have saved her". "It was a terrible loss to me", said Kate UNK feeling the pain twist again at the UNK knowing now that Juanita must have written to him at UNK "Where will you go now that you're leaving UNK she asked him, seeing UNK eyes grow UNK "As you know, General McClellan has been occupying Beverly.

"When are you to UNK Kate asked, watching them both now UNK Their eyes betrayed too much of their emotions, she thought UNK UNK Would you permit Juanita to walk about the grounds with me for a short spell, Mrs& UNK UNK here in the parlor where it's UNK she said, trying to be calm. It would be better for Joel and Uncle Randolph and Mrs& Tussle not to see them. Kate went back and reminded the kitchen women of the supper UNK Then she took UNK UNK to UNK young aide where he sat in the cool of the big trees around the flower garden. When UNK called to his aide and the pair rode off down the River Road where the UNK burned blue, Juanita was shaken and trying not to cry. She sought Kate out UNK her lips UNK "He wants me to go with him UNK she told Kate. "What do you want to do"? Kate asked, uneasy at the gravity of the girl's dilemma. "I could go with him. He knows me as your UNK which, of course, I am. But I am a UNK You UNK me.

The things left UNK they both felt UNK and with a sigh they fell back on the UNK UNK UNK put out the remaining candles with a long UNK and in the smell of UNK UNK the comforting awareness of each other's bodies, the retained pattern of dancers and guests remembered, their minds grew numb and then empty of images. They UNK UNK with a UNK high-pitched UNK the damn UNK ivory teeth watching him from a UNK table. ## In the ballroom below, the dark had given way to moonlight coming in through the bank of French windows. It was a delayed moon, but now the sky had cleared of UNK black and the stars UNK the UNK sky. Martha UNK old, slow, careful of foot, came down the great UNK dressed in her best UNK black UNK her UNK shoe UNK held forward. "Well, I'm here at UNK she said, addressing the old portraits on the walls. "I don't hear the music. I am getting UNK I must admit it".

Peter, you UNK you've forgot to order the UNK She stood there, a large old woman, smiling at the things she would say to him in the morning, this big foolish baby of a son. There were times now, like this, when she lost control of the time count and moved freely back and forth into three generations. Was it a birthday UNK When Peter had reached his majority at UNK Or was it her own first ball as UNK of this big house, a Van UNK bride from way UNK near Albany, from UNK And this handsome UNK staring and UNK was he her UNK Martha picked up the UNK of her gown and with eyes closed she slowly began to dance a UNK UNK around the UNK ## David UNK was tired beyond almost the limits of his flesh. He had ridden hard from Boston, and he was not used to UNK Now, driving the horse and sulky borrowed from UNK UNK he felt as if every bone was topped by burning oil and that every muscle was ready to dissolve into UNK and leave his big body helpless and unable to move. The road leading south along the river was shaded with old trees, and in the moonlight the UNK landscape was like a setting for UNK and wood gods rather than the Hudson River Valley of his boyhood UNK He UNK the reins on the back of the powerful gray horse and held on as the UNK wheels hit a UNK and came out with a UNK and went on. He would cross to Manhattan, to Harlem UNK before morning. There a certain farmhouse was a station for the Sons of UNK He would send on by trusted messenger the dispatches with their UNK news. And he would sleep, sleep, and never think of roads and UNK sore UNK of colonial wars. UNK how everything here fitted back into his life, even if he had been away so long. UNK Sir UNK the valley society, the very smell of the river on his right UNK along to the bay past fish UNK and UNK and ahead the sleepy ribbon of UNK road. A mist was walking on the water, white as cotton, but with a UNK and merging grace. UNK there was a stirring of sudden movement at a UNK David reached for the pair of UNK in the UNK at his feet. He pulled out one of them and cocked it. A strange wood creature came floating up from a patch of UNK UNK It was a grotesque hen, five or six feet UNK It had the features of a man UNK by UNK of loose UNK It UNK this apocalyptic UNK on two thin UNK and its UNK were they UNK UNK UNK as it ran. Its UNK was UNK Black strips of skin hung from it. The horse UNK at the dreadful thing and flared its UNK David took a firm hand with it. The creature in feathers looked around and David saw the mad eyes, glazed with an insane fear. The UNK bird thing ran away, and to David its UNK sounded like the crowing of a UNK UNK Then it was gone. He drove on, wary and UNK The Sons were out tonight. #CHAPTER UNK New York lay UNK in the summer sun, and the morning fish hawk, flying in the heated air, saw below him the long triangular wedge of Manhattan Island. It was thickly settled by fifteen thousand citizens and laid out into UNK streets, mostly around the UNK going UNK north to Wall Street, but giving up and becoming fields and farms in the region of Harlem Heights. From there it looked across at Westchester County and the Hudson River where the manor houses, UNK and big farms of the original UNK UNK began. On the east side of the island of Manhattan the indifferent UNK knew the East River that connected New York Bay with Long Island UNK On the western tip of Long Island UNK Brooklyn Heights. It commanded a view over Manhattan and the harbor. A fringe of housing and gardens bearded the top of the heights, and behind it were UNK roads leading past farms and UNK UNK was bounded by UNK UNK and there were grazing cattle. On the shores north and south, the UNK and UNK UNK lived along the UNK Great South Bay and the narrow barrier of UNK Fire Island. The morning hawk, hungry for any UNK UNK UNK UNK kept his eyes on the ring of anchored ships that lay off the shores in the bay, sheltered by the Jersey UNK They often threw UNK UNK The larger ships were near UNK UNK already being called, by a few, Jersey City. These were the ships of His UNK Navy, UNK the UNK of the East Indies merchants and the UNK and UNK of the UNK The news of battle on UNK Hill had already UNK through, and New York itself was now left in the hands of the local UNK Congress. The fish hawk, his wings not moving, circled and UNK lower.

UNK for more ships, more UNK infantry, and asked UNK was to be done with a war of UNK ## David UNK having slept away a day and a night, came awake in a plank farmhouse on the Harlem River near UNK UNK He looked out through UNK turned a faint UNK by sun and weather, looked out at King's Bridge toward UNK The road seemed animated with a few more wagons than UNK a carriage raising up the choking June dust, and beyond, in a UNK a local militia company drilling with UNK UNK UNK every kind of horse pistol, old UNK or UNK The UNK events of the last few days flooded UNK mind and he rubbed his UNK chin and felt again the ache in his kidneys caused by his saddle UNK from Boston. UNK UNK he UNK He had sent the dispatches downtown to the proper people and had UNK Now there was more to do. Orders not written down had to be transmitted to the local provincial government. He scratched his UNK neck. From the UNK hung on a UNK chair, David took out a good English UNK a present from John UNK He found UNK water in a pitcher and a last bit of UNK and he UNK his face and stood UNK the razor on his broad leather belt, its UNK held firm by a UNK of the UNK **h. He hoped he was free of UNK Here he was, suddenly caught up in the delirium of a war, in the spite and UNK of Whigs and UNK There would be great need soon for his skill as surgeon, but somehow he had not planned to use his knowledge merely for war. David UNK had certain psychic UNK that this rebellion was not wholly what it appeared on the surface. He knew that many were using it for their own ends. But it did not matter. He UNK the razor UNK what UNK was that a new concept of Americans was being UNK That some men did not want it he could understand. The moral UNK of merchants made them loyal usually to their UNK Yet UNK like Morris UNK would UNK themselves for the new ideas. UNK circumstances would test us all, he decided. UNK and UNK would occur. No doubt John UNK would do well now; war was a UNK heaven. And what of that poor UNK and UNK UNK he had seen on the road driving down from UNK Things like that would increase rather than be done away with. One had to believe in final events or one was stranded in the abyss of nothing. He saw with John Hunter now that the UNK of man was a dream. Life was a short play of UNK UNK David began to shave with great sweeping strokes. Time plays an essential part in our mortality, and suddenly for no reason he could imagine (or UNK the image of UNK laughing filled his mind- so desirable, so UNK so full of UNK of pleasure and joy.

He was proud that he had never worn a UNK More and more of the UNK were wearing their own hair and not using powder. He felt cheerful again, UNK UNK in his UNK brown suit, the UNK riding boots.

He began to pack the UNK <And all this too shall pass UNK it came to him out of some dim corner of memory from a church service when he was a UNK yes, in a white church with a thin spur steeple in the UNK Hudson UNK where a feeling of UNK was normal in those UNK UNK with their UNK UNK UNK UNK men and UNK women in drab black rags carried on in a primitive way, almost UNK from feudal times. UNK puzzled UNK He wondered how they could go on in poverty, UNK UNK with a complete lack of desire to make either their land or their lives flourish. Andrei remembered a UNK meeting long ago. UNK UNK had returned from the colonies in Palestine and, before the national leadership, exalted the miracles of drying up UNK and UNK the UNK A fund-raising drive to buy tractors and machinery was UNK Andrei remembered that his own reaction had been one of UNK Had he found the meaning too UNK It UNK him. The land of the Lublin UNK was rich, but no one seemed to care.

"I do not care if your beliefs take you along a path of religion or a path of labor or a path of UNK We are here because all our paths travel a blind course through a thick forest, seeking human dignity.

We all seek the same thing through different UNK an end to this long night of two thousand years of darkness and unspeakable abuses which will continue to plague us until the Star of David flies over UNK This was how Alexander Brandel expressed pure UNK It had sounded good to UNK but he did not believe it. In his heart he had no desire to go to UNK He loathed the idea of drying up UNK or the UNK of UNK or of leaving his natural UNK Before he went into battle Andrei had told UNK "I only want to be a UNK Warsaw is my city, not UNK UNK And now Andrei sat on a train on the way to Lublin and wondered if he was not being punished for his lack of belief. Warsaw! He saw the smug eyes of the Home Army UNK UNK and all the Romans and the faces of the peasants who held only hatred for him. They had let this black hole of death in UNK heart exist without a cry of UNK Once there had been big glittering rooms where UNK bowed and kissed the ladies' hands as they UNK from behind their UNK Warsaw! Warsaw! UNK UNK I am a UNK Day by day, week by week, month by month, the betrayal UNK at UNK heart. He ground his teeth together. I hate UNK he said to himself. I hate Poland and all the UNK mothers' sons of them. All of Poland is a UNK The terrible vision of the ghetto streets flooded his mind. What matters now? What is beyond this UNK Only UNK and I will never live to see Palestine because I did not believe. By late afternoon the train UNK into the UNK yards in the UNK at Lublin, which was filled with lines of cars poised to pour the tools of war to the Russian front. At a UNK another train which was a familiar sight these days. UNK Jews. UNK skilled eye sized them up. They were not UNK He guessed by their appearance that they were UNK He walked toward the center of the city to keep his rendezvous with Styka. Of all the places in Poland, Andrei hated Lublin the most. The UNK were all gone. Few of the native Jews who had lived in Lublin were still in the UNK From the moment of the occupation Lublin became a focal point. He and UNK watched it carefully. Lublin generally was the forerunner of what would happen elsewhere. Early in 1939, UNK UNK the UNK of UNK established ~SS headquarters for all of Poland. The UNK ran a check on UNK and had only to conclude that he was in a UNK of war with Hans Frank and the civilian UNK UNK built the UNK Corps. Lublin was the seed of action for the UNK UNK of the Jewish problem. As the messages from UNK UNK and Eichmann came in through Alfred UNK UNK UNK UNK A bevy of UNK UNK work camps, concentration camps erupted in the area. UNK thousand Jewish prisoners of war disappeared into UNK UNK Plans went in and out of Lublin, indicating German confusion. A tale of a massive reservation in the UNK to hold several million Jews **h A tale of a plan to ship all Jews to the island of UNK **h UNK of the UNK of the guards at UNK camps struck a chord of terror at the mere mention of their names. UNK 7, UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK electric UNK UNK wild dogs, UNK UNK The UNK Corps took in Ukrainian and Baltic UNK and the UNK UNK UNK in blood and turned into UNK UNK UNK Lublin was their heart.

In and in and in they poured through the gates of UNK but they never left, and Majdanek was not growing any larger. What was happening in UNK Was Operation UNK the same pattern for the daily trains now leaving the UNK in UNK Was there another Majdanek in the Warsaw area, as they UNK Andrei stopped at UNK Place and looked around quickly at the boundary of civil UNK His watch told him he was still UNK Down the UNK he could see a portion of the ghetto wall. He found an empty bench, opened a newspaper, and stretched his legs before him. UNK Boulevard was filled with black Nazi uniforms and the dirty UNK ones of their UNK "Captain UNK Andrei glanced up over the top of the paper and looked into the UNK homely face of Sergeant Styka. Styka sat beside him and UNK his hand UNK "I have been waiting across the street at the post office since dawn. I thought you might get in on a morning UNK "It's good to see you again, Styka". Styka studied his UNK He almost broke into tears. To him, Andrei UNK had always been the living symbol of a Polish officer. His captain was thin and UNK and his beautiful boots were worn and UNK "Remember to call me UNK Andrei said. Styka nodded and sniffed and blew his nose UNK "When that woman found me and told me that you needed me I was never so happy since before the war". "I'm lucky that you were still living in UNK Styka UNK about fate. "For a time I thought of trying to reach the Free Polish Forces, but one thing led to another.

Styka shook his head slowly. "I am only a simple soldier. I cannot think things out too well. Until I was transferred into the Seventh UNK I was like every other Pole in my feeling about Jews. I hated you when I first came in. But **h my captain might have been a Jew, but he wasn't a Jew. What I mean is, he was a Pole and the greatest soldier in the UNK UNK sir. The men of our company had a dozen fights defending your name. You never knew about it, but by God, we taught them respect for Captain UNK Andrei smiled. "Since the war I have seen the way the Germans have behaved and I think, Holy UNK we have behaved like this for hundreds of years. UNK "How can you tell an insane man to reason or a blind man to UNK "But we are neither blind nor UNK The men of your company would not allow your name UNK Why do we let the Germans do this"? "I have sat many hours with this, Styka. All I ever wanted was to be a free man in my own country. I've lost faith, Styka. I used to love this country and believe that someday we'd win our battle for UNK But now I think I hate it very much". "And do you really think that the world outside Poland will care any more than we do"? The question frightened UNK UNK don't go inside UNK "I'm still a soldier in a very small way, Styka". It was an answer that Styka understood. UNK UNK was beyond the bridge over the River UNK near the rail center. Grabski sat in a UNK UNK cursing the excessive heat which clamped an uneasy stillness before UNK He was a square brick of a man with a UNK face and UNK Polish features. UNK swarmed around the bowl of UNK in which he UNK thick black bread. Half of it UNK down his UNK He washed it down with beer and produced a UNK UNK UNK Andrei demanded. Grabski looked at the pair of them. He UNK a sort of UNK answer. "My cousin works at the Labor Bureau. He can make you work papers. It will take a few days. I will get you inside the guard camp as a member of my crew. I don't know if I can get you into the inner camp.

Grabski had never seen so much money. His broad flat fingers, UNK into massive sausages by years of UNK snatched the bills UNK "This ain't UNK "You get the rest when I'm safely out of UNK "I ain't taking no UNK chances for no Jew business". Andrei and Styka were silent. She was getting real dramatic. I'd have been more impressed if I hadn't remembered that she'd played UNK UNK in her UNK UNK course. I didn't want her back on that broken record. UNK free in the whole UNK world", was all I could think of to say. When I'd delivered myself of that gem there was nothing to do but order up another drink. "I am", she said. I'd forgotten all about Thelma and the Kentucky Derby and how it was UNK fifty dollars I was spending. It was just me and Eileen getting drunk together like we used to in the old days, and me staring at her across the table crazy to get my hands on her partly because I wanted to UNK her neck because she was so UNK but mostly because she was so wonderful to touch. UNK or sober she was the most attractive woman in the world for me. I was crazy about her all over again. It was the call of the wild all right. That evening turned out to be hell like all the others. We moved down Broadway from UNK to UNK It was the same old routine. Eileen got to dancing, just a little tiny dancing step to a UNK tune that you could hardly UNK and trying to pick up strange men, but each time I was ready to say to hell with it and walk out she'd pull herself together and talk so UNK in that sweet UNK voice about the good times and the happiness we'd had together and there I was back on the UNK I did have the decency to call up Thelma and tell her I'd met old friends and would be home late. "I could scratch her eyes out", Eileen cried and stamped her foot when I came back from the phone UNK "You know I don't like my men to have other women. I hate it. I hate it". She got so drunk I had to take her home. It was a walk up on Hudson Street. She just about made me carry her upstairs and then she clung to me and wouldn't let me go. There was a man's jacket on the chair and a straw hat on the table. The place UNK of some kind of hair UNK these UNK characters use. "What about UNK I had to shake her to make her listen. UNK What about UNK Suddenly she was very mysterious and dramatic. UNK and I allow each other absolute freedom. We are above being UNK He's used to me bringing home strange men. I'll just tell him you're my husband. He can't object to that". UNK I object. If he pokes his nose in here I'll slug him". "That really would be UNK She began to UNK She was still laughing when I grabbed her and started rolling her on the bed. After all I'm made of flesh and blood. I'm not a plaster UNK UNK up was UNK Never in my life have I felt so UNK about anything I've done as I did about spending that night with my own wife. We both had UNK Eileen declared she couldn't lift her head from the UNK She lay under the covers making UNK motions with her UNK telling me where to look for the UNK I was stumbling in my UNK trying to find my way around her damn UNK when I UNK that UNK sweet UNK smell. There was somebody else in the apartment. I UNK UNK I could feel the hair stand up on the back of my neck like a UNK that is going to get into a fight. I turned around with the UNK in my hand. My eyes were so UNK I could barely see him but there he was, a little smooth UNK guy in a new spring UNK and a UNK UNK Brown eyes, UNK UNK UNK face without an expression in the world. We didn't have time to speak before Eileen's voice was UNK at us from the bed. UNK Maria UNK meet Francis UNK UNK UNK meet UNK She gave the UNK laugh I ever heard. "And don't either of you forget that I'm not any man's property. If you want to fight, go down on the UNK She was enjoying the situation. Imagine that. Eileen was a psychologist all right. Instead of wanting to UNK the poor bastard I found myself having a UNK for him. Maybe he felt the same way. I never felt such a UNK UNK in my life. First thing I knew he was in the UNK cooking up the breakfast and I was handing Eileen her UNK and she was lying there handsome as a queen among her UNK I couldn't face Thelma after that night. I didn't even have the nerve to call her on the telephone. I wrote her that I'd met up with Eileen and that old bonds had proved too strong and asked her to send my clothes down by UNK Of course I had to give her Eileen's address, but she never came near us. All she did was write me a pleasant little note about how it was beautiful while it lasted but that now life had UNK our ways and it was UNK forever. She never said a word about the fifty dollars. She added a UNK begging me to be careful about drinking. I must know that that was my greatest weakness UNK three times. UNK I learned that Eileen had called Thelma on the telephone and made a big scene about Thelma trying to take her husband away. That finished me with UNK UNK Eileen to squeeze all the drama out of a situation. And there I was UNK up with Eileen in that filthy fourth floor attic on Hudson Street. I use the phrase UNK because there was something positively indecent about our relationship. I felt it and it ate on me all the time, but I didn't know how right I was till later. What I did know was that Precious was always around. He slept in the hall bedroom at the head of the stairs. "Who do you think pays the UNK You wouldn't have me throw the poor boy out on the UNK Eileen said when I UNK her about it. I said sure that was what I wanted her to do but she paid no attention. Eileen had a wonderful way of not listening to things she didn't want to hear. Still I didn't think she was UNK me with Precious right then. To be on the safe side I never let Eileen get out of my sight day or night. Precious had me worried. I couldn't make out what his UNK was. I'd thought him a UNK or procurer but he didn't seem to be. He was smooth and civil spoken but it seemed to me there was something tough under his UNK manner. Still he let Eileen treat him like a UNK Whenever the place was cleaned or a meal served it was Precious who did the work. I never could find out what his business was. He always seemed to have money in his pocket. The phone had been UNK but UNK came for him and notes by special messenger. Now and then he would disappear for several days. UNK was all he would say with that smooth hurt smile when I put leading questions. "Oh he's just an international UNK Eileen would shout with her UNK UNK Poor devil he can't have been too happy either. He got no relief from drink because, though sometimes Precious would buy himself a drink if he went out with us in the evening, he'd leave it on the table untouched. When I was in liquor I rode him pretty hard I UNK Occasionally if I pushed him too far he'd give me a look out of narrowed eyes and the hard cruel bony UNK would show through that smooth face of his. "Some UNK I told UNK "that guy will kill us UNK She just wouldn't listen. Getting drunk every night was the only way I could handle the situation. Eileen seemed to feel the same way. We still had that much in UNK The trouble was drinking cost money. The way Eileen and I were hitting it up, we needed ten or fifteen dollars an evening. Eileen must have UNK a little out of UNK I raised some UNK by UNK the good clothes I had left over from my respectable uptown life, but when that was gone I didn't have a cent. I don't know what we would have done if Pat UNK hadn't come to town. Pat UNK looked like a heavier UNK He had the same bullet head of UNK reddish hair but he didn't have UNK UNK humor or his brains or his charm. He was a big thick UNK violent man. Now Pat may have been a UNK and a UNK but he was a good UNK Catholic and he loved his little sister. Those UNK had that Irish UNK that made them stick together in spite of politics and everything. Pat took Eileen and me out to dinner at a swell UNK house and told us with tears in his eyes how happy he was we had come together again. UNK God hath UNK etcetera. The UNK were real religious people except for Kate.

"But brother I can't take a job right now", she said with her eyes on her ice cream, "I'm going to have a baby, Francis UNK baby, my own husband's UNK My first thought was how had it happened so soon, but I counted back on my fingers and sure enough we'd been living together six weeks. Pat meanwhile was UNK over with sentiment. Greatest thing that ever happened. Now Eileen really would have to settle down to love honor and UNK and she'd have to quit drinking. UNK come East for the UNK by God he would. When we separated that evening Pat pushed a hundred dollar bill into Eileen's hand to help towards a UNK Before he left town Pat saw to it that I was fixed up with a job. Pat had contacts all over the labor movement. A friend of UNK named Frank Sposato had just UNK into the UNK Union. The UNK were retired UNK and small time UNK off UNK and UNK who acted as UNK on the UNK Most of them were elderly men. It was responsible and sometimes dangerous work because the UNK is awful in the port of New York. They weren't as well paid as they should have been. One reason the UNK let Sposato take them over was to get the protection of his UNK Sposato needed a front, some labor stiff with a clean record to act as business agent of the UNK UNK There I was a retired UNK and structural iron worker UNK never UNK a cent off a fellow worker in my thirty years in the movement. For once UNK was a recommendation. Sposato couldn't wait to get me UNK With my gray hair and my UNK countenance I certainly looked the honest working UNK The things a man will do for a woman. There was one fact which Rector could not UNK one truth which he could not UNK As long as there were two human beings working together on the same project, there would be competition and you could no more escape it than you could expect to escape the UNK No matter how devoted a man was, no matter how fully he gave his life to the Lord, he could never UNK that one spark of pride that gave him definition as an individual. All of the jobs in the mission might be equal in the eyes of the Lord, but they were certainly not equal in the eyes of the Lord's servants. It was only natural that Fletcher would strive for a position in which he could make the decisions. Even Rector himself was prey to this spirit of competition and he knew it, not for a more exalted office in the hierarchy of the UNK his ambitions for the UNK had died very early in his UNK but for the one clear victory he had talked about to the colonel. He was not sure how much of this desire was due to his devotion to the church and how much was his own UNK demanding to be satisfied, for the two were UNK and could not be separated. He wanted desperately to see Kayabashi defeated, the Communists in the village rooted out, the mission standing UNK for in the triumph of the Lord he himself would be UNK too. But perhaps this was a part of the eternal plan, that man's ambition when linked with God would be a driving, UNK force for good in the world. He UNK How foolish it was to try to UNK the truth in an area where only faith would UNK He would have to work without questioning the motives which made him work and content himself with the thought that the eventual victory, however it was brought about, would be sweet indeed. His first move was to send Hino to the village to spend a few days. His arm had been giving him some trouble and Rector was not enough of a medical expert to determine whether it had healed UNK or whether Hino was simply UNK against the tedious work in the print shop, using the UNK in his arm as an UNK In any event Rector sent him to the local hospital to have it UNK telling him to keep his ears open while he was in the village to see if he could find out what Kayabashi was planning. Hino was UNK at the UNK He was allowed to spend his nights at an inn near the hospital and he was given some extra money to go to the UNK UNK an excellent place to make contact with the enemy. He left with all the UNK spirit of a child going on a holiday, nodding UNK as Rector gave him his final instructions. He was to get involved in no UNK he was to try to make no UNK he was simply to listen and report back what he heard. It was a ridiculous situation and Rector knew it, for UNK frankly UNK openly UNK would make a poor espionage agent. If he wanted to know anything, he would end up asking about it UNK but in this UNK manner he would probably receive more UNK answers than if he tried to get them by UNK In all of his experience in the mission field Rector had never seen a convert quite like UNK From the moment that Hino had first walked into the mission to ask for a job, any job- his qualifications neatly written on a piece of paper in a precise UNK he had been ready to become a Christian. He had already been studying the UNK he knew the UNK and after studying with Fletcher for a time he approached UNK announced that he wanted to be baptized and that was that. Rector had never been able to find out much about UNK past. Hino talked very little about himself except for the UNK times when he used a personal illustration in connection with another subject. UNK the pieces of this mosaic together, Rector had the vague outlines of a UNK Hino was the fourth son of an elderly farmer who lived on the coast, in UNK and divided his life between the land and the sea, UNK the marginal UNK on his small rented farm with seasonal employment on a fishing boat. Without exception UNK brothers turned to either one or both of their father's UNK but Hino showed a talent for neither and instead spent most of his time on the beach where he repaired UNK and proved immensely popular as a UNK He had gone into the Japanese UNK had been trained as an officer, had participated in one or two UNK he never went into detail regarding his military experience- and at the age of UNK quite as a bolt out of the blue, he had walked into the mission as if he belonged here and had become a Christian. Rector was often UNK often tempted to ask questions but he never did. If and when Hino decided to tell him about his experiences, he would do so UNK Rector had no doubt that Hino would come back from the village bursting with information, ready to UNK it with his customary UNK UNK UNK with his active UNK When the telephone rang on the day after Hino went down to the village, Rector had a UNK it would be Hino with some UNK of information too important to wait until his return, for there were few UNK in the village and the phone in Rector's office rarely rang unless it was important. He was surprised to find UNK secretary on the other end of the line. He was even more startled when he heard what Kayabashi wanted. The <oyabun> was entertaining a group of UNK the secretary said, businessmen from Tokyo for the most part, and Kayabashi wished to show them the mission. They had never seen one before and had expressed a curiosity about it. UNK Rector said. "I guess it will be all right. When would the <oyabun> like to bring his guests up UNK "This UNK the secretary said. "At three o'clock if it will be of convenience to you at that time". "All right", Rector said. "I will be expecting them". He was about to hang up the phone, but a note of UNK in the secretary's voice left the conversation open. He had something more to say. "I beg to inquire if the back is now safe for UNK he said. Rector laughed despite himself. UNK the <oyabun> has been working on it", he said, then checked himself and added: "You can tell UNK that the back road is in very good condition and will be quite safe for his party to UNK UNK UNK The secretary sighed with relief and then the telephone clicked in Rector's hand. Rector had no idea why Kayabashi wanted to visit the mission. For the <oyabun> to make such a trip was either a sign of great weakness or an indication of equally great confidence, and from all the available information it was probably the latter. Kayabashi must feel fairly certain of his victory in order to make a visit like this, a trip which could be so easily UNK by the people in the village. At the same time, it was unlikely that any businessmen would spend a day in a Christian mission out of mere curiosity. No, Kayabashi was bringing his associates here for a specific purpose and Rector would not be able to UNK it until they UNK When he had given the call a few moments thought, he went into the kitchen to ask Mrs& UNK to prepare tea and UNK for the visitors, using the formal English china and the silver tea service which had been donated to the mission, then he went outside to inspect the grounds. UNK had a pile of UNK near one side of the UNK Rector asked him to move it for the time UNK he wanted the mission compound to be UNK UNK A good initial impression would be important now. He went into the print shop, where Fletcher had just finished cleaning the press. "How many pamphlets do we have in UNK Rector said. "I should say about a hundred UNK Fletcher said. UNK "I would like to enact a little UNK this UNK Rector said, He explained about the visit and the effect he wished to UNK the picture of a very busy mission. He did not wish to UNK Kayabashi UNK just to display the mission activities in a graphic and impressive manner. Fletcher nodded as he listened to the instructions and said he would arrange the things Rector UNK Rector's next stop was at the UNK where UNK was monitoring a test. He beckoned to her from the door and she slipped quietly outside. He told her of the visitors and then of his plans. "How many children do you have present today"? he said. She looked back toward the UNK UNK she said. "No, only UNK The little UNK girl had to go home. She has a pretty bad UNK "I would like them to appear very busy today, not busy UNK but UNK UNK full of life. I want to create the impression of a compound full of children. Do you think you can manage it"? UNK smiled. "I'll UNK As Rector was walking back toward the residential hall, Johnson came out of the basement and bounded up to him. The UNK in the coffee house had done little to UNK his spirits, but he was still a little wary around Rector for they had not yet discussed the incident. "I think I've fixed the pump so we won't have to worry about it for a long time", he said. "I've adjusted the gauge so that the pump cuts out before the water gets too UNK UNK Rector said. He looked out over the expanse of the UNK It was going to take a lot of activity to fill it. "Have you ever operated a UNK he said. "No, UNK Johnson said. "You are about to become a first-class UNK Rector said. "When UNK gets back with the UNK I want you to round up two or three Japanese boys. UNK can help you. You'll find an old transit in the basement. The glass is out of it, but that won't matter. It looks pretty efficient and that's the important UNK He went on to explain what he had in mind. Johnson UNK He said he could do it. Rector was warming to his over-all strategy by the time he got back to the residential hall. It was rather a childish game, all in all, but everybody seemed to be getting into the spirit of the thing and he could not remember when he had enjoyed planning anything quite so much. He was not sure what effect it would have, but that was really beside the point when you got right down to it. He was not going to lose the mission by UNK and whatever reason Kayabashi had for bringing his little UNK group to the mission, he was going to be in for a UNK He found Elizabeth in the parlor and asked her to make sure everything was in order in the residential hall, and then to take charge of the office while the party was here. When everything had been done, Rector went back to his desk to occupy himself with his monthly report until three o'clock. At two thirty he sent UNK to the top of the wall at the northeast corner of the mission to keep an eye on the ridge road and give a signal when he first UNK the approach of UNK party. Then UNK UNK in his best blue UNK suit, sat in a chair out on the UNK in the shade of a tree, UNK a cigarette and waiting. The air was cooler here, and the UNK pattern of the trees threw a UNK shadow on the grass, an effect which he found pleasant. She concluded by asking him to name another hour should this one be UNK The fish took the UNK He replied that he could not imagine what importance there might be in thus meeting with a UNK UNK joy of UNK he would be at home at the hour mentioned. But when she called he had thought better of the matter and decided not to involve himself in a new UNK She was told by the UNK who opened the door that his lordship was engaged on work from which he had left strict orders he was not to be UNK Claire was bitterly disappointed but determined not to let the rebuff UNK her purpose. She wrote again and now, abandoning for the moment the theme of love, she asked for help in the matter of her career. She could act and she could write. His lordship was concerned in the management of Drury Lane but, if there were no opportunities there, would he read and criticize her UNK At last he consented to meet her, and following that brief interview Claire wrote him a yet more remarkable UNK Have you any objection to the following plan? On Thursday evening we may go out of town together by some stage or mail about the distance of ten or twelve miles. There we shall be free and UNK we can return the following morning **h She concluded by asking for a brief UNK "to settle with you UNK and she threw in a tribute to his UNK UNK and "the wild originality of your UNK She opened his reply with trembling fingers **h he UNK And he would see her that evening. Victory at UNK At their meeting he told her not to bother about UNK he would attend to that. There was one of the new UNK in the room and, as Claire rose to go, he asked her to sing him one song before she left. She sang him UNK charming ballad UNK which was the vogue of the moment. She had never sung better. "Your voice is UNK he approved with a warm smile. UNK will be a new experience- I have never before made love to a UNK **h. There have been UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK a proud UNK a silly UNK and a UNK UNK whom I was silly enough to mate with and who is now busy tearing at my UNK And so they went, he choosing of all places an inn near UNK UNK scene a generation ago of the UNK UNK of the UNK Club.

She was the UNK as clearly as was Venus in Shakespeare's poem. And while her UNK did not suffer from UNK UNK might well be an equal UNK No, she would not pretend UNK but neither must she be UNK UNK UNK that was the thing. In the bedroom she would insist on darkness. With his club foot he might well be grateful. At the UNK which was situated close to a broad UNK Byron was greeted by the landlord with UNK UNK and addressed as UNK The place was evidently a familiar haunt and Claire wondered what other UNK loves had been celebrated in the comfortable rooms to which they were shown. The fire in the sitting room was UNK "What about the UNK Byron UNK UNK to me last time I was here the grate UNK out smoke as it might have been preparing us for UNK "We found some UNK had built a nest in the UNK UNK but I promise you you'll never have trouble of that sort again". So, not only had he been here before, but it seemed he might well come again. Claire felt suddenly small and cheap, heroine of a trivial episode in the voluminous history of Don UNK A cold supper was ordered and a bottle of UNK When UNK ship had borne him to UNK French wines had started to cross the UNK the first shipments in a dozen UNK years, but the supplies had not yet reached rural UNK where the sweet wines of the Spanish UNK still ruled. As they waited for supper they sat by the fire, glasses in hand, while Byron UNK as much for his own entertainment as UNK UNK is UNK he said. "The great Greek tragedies are concerned with man against UNK not man against man for the prize of a woman's body. So don't see yourself as a heroine or fancy this little adventure is an event of major UNK "The gods seemed to think sex pretty UNK she UNK UNK and Venus, UNK and UNK Jupiter and UNK Byron and the UNK of the UNK UNK That would be UNK I UNK Wasn't the UNK her UNK Byron laughed. "So you know something of the UNK do you"? UNK me about UNK how she UNK what she did to please you". "I'll tell you nothing. I don't ask you who UNK you're being UNK to, husband or UNK UNK I don't UNK For a moment she thought of answering with the truth but she knew there were men who UNK away from UNK who demanded some degree of education in body as well as mind. "Very well", she said, "I'll not UNK you. What matter the others so long as I have my place in history". She was striking the right note. No man ever had a better opinion of himself and indeed, with one so UNK UNK could hardly seem UNK UNK and beauty, high position in both the social and intellectual UNK athlete, fabled UNK if ever the world was any man's oyster it was his. The light supper over, Claire went to him and, slipping an arm about his shoulder, sat on his knee. He drew her close and, hand on UNK turned her face to his. Her lips, moist and UNK spoke his name. UNK His hand went to her shoulder and pushed aside the UNK UNK that UNK the UNK UNK UNK then, to better purpose, he took hold of the knot and with UNK fingers, UNK it. The UNK beneath was UNK and, withdrawing his lips from UNK he set her UNK on his knee and started to UNK it, UNK as if she were a child. But, UNK by his UNK his UNK hand, her desire was UNK She sprang up and went swiftly to the bedroom. Lord Byron poured himself another glass of wine and held it up to the candle flame admiring the rich color. He drank slowly with due appreciation. It was an excellent UNK He rose and went to the bedroom. UNK in the UNK he said: "The form of the human female, unlike her mind and her spirit, is the most challenging loveliness in all nature". ## When Claire returned to UNK she longed to tell them she had become Byron's UNK By odd coincidence, on the evening of her return Shelley chose to read UNK which was the latest of the titled poet's successes. As he UNK the UNK measures, it was as much as Claire could do to restrain herself from bursting out with her dramatic UNK UNK it is not the best of which he is UNK said Shelley as he closed the book, "it is still poetry of a high UNK "If he would only leave the UNK said Mary. "I am tired of UNK and UNK "The hero of his next poem is Napoleon UNK said UNK with slightly UNK UNK "How do you know that"? demanded Mary.

At the same time another UNK this one of Shelley's UNK was given to the world: UNK a poem of UNK beauty in which the reader may gaze into the still depths of a fine mind's UNK UNK was published only to be UNK UNK UNK ignored. Shelley sent a copy to UNK a former friend, and another to UNK Neither acknowledged the UNK Only Mary's praise sustained him in his UNK She understood completely. Not a thought nor a UNK was missed in her summary of appreciation.

"A public of one", Mary echoed UNK "how can you say such a UNK There will be thousands who will thrill to the loveliness of UNK There are some even now.

The careless writing was in keeping with his mood of savage UNK On all sides doors were being slammed in his face. The previous UNK UNK UNK as they were, had only served to increase his popularity. Now, under the impact of his wife's UNK he was brought suddenly to the realization that there was a limit to UNK however brilliant, however UNK the UNK might be. He tried defiance and openly UNK his devotion to his half sister, but he soon saw, as did she, that this course if persisted in would involve them in a common UNK For the moment there was no woman in his life, and it was this vacuum that had given Claire her opportunity.

Below he could see the bright UNK lighting the UNK He glanced back. The colonel crouched UNK on one of the UNK chairs, methodically tearing at his UNK #@ 9 UNK THE UNK was a UNK structure of heavy timbers covered with earth. It stood some fifty paces from the edge of the bank. From the outside, it seemed no more than a low UNK a UNK on the dark earth. A crude ladder ran down to a wooden floor. Two UNK enabled observers to watch across the river. The place smelled strongly of rank, fertile earth, UNK wood and UNK The plank floor was UNK beneath Watson's boots. At least the Union officer had been decent enough to provide a UNK There was no place to sit, but Watson walked slowly from the ladder to the window UNK and back, stooping slightly to avoid striking his head on the heavy UNK In the corner was the soldier with the white flag. He stood UNK UNK UNK the staff, his body half hidden by the UNK cloth. Watson hardly looked at him. The man had come UNK aboard the flat-bottomed barge at the last instant, UNK the flag of UNK Someone had hauled him over the side, and he had remained silent while they UNK An officer with a squad of men had been waiting on the bank. The men in the boats had started yelling happily at first sight of the officer, two of them calling him UNK When the boat had UNK the weaker ones and the two wounded men had been lifted out and carried away by the soldiers. Watson had presented his UNK and been led to the UNK The officer had told him that both lists must be checked. Watson had given his name and asked for a UNK pass. The officer, UNK said he would have to see. Watson had nodded absently and UNK that he would check the lists himself later. He had peered through the darkness at the UNK The men he would take back across the river stood there, but he turned away from them. He wanted no part of the emotions of the exchange, no memory of the joy and gratitude that other men felt. He had hoped to be alone in the UNK but the soldier had followed him. Though Watson carefully ignored the man, he could not deny his presence. Perhaps it would be better to speak to him, since silence could not UNK his form. Watson glanced briefly at him, seeing only a body rigidly erect behind the UNK UNK UNK won't be too long. If my pass is approved, I may be a half hour. The soldier answered in a curious, muffled voice, his lips barely moving. Watson turned away and did not see the man's knees UNK and his body UNK UNK sir. He had acknowledged the man. It was easier to think now, Watson decided. The stiff figure in the corner no longer blocked his thoughts. He paced slowly, UNK staring at the damp, UNK floor. He tried to order the words of the three Union officers, seeking to create some coherent portrait of the dead boy. But he UNK UNK His lack of success steadily eroded his interest. He stopped UNK leaned against the UNK UNK wall and let his mind drift. A feeling of UNK an UNK of mind greater than any fatigue he had ever known, UNK through him. What in the name of God was he doing, crouched in a UNK pit on the wrong bank of the UNK Why had he crossed the dark water, to bring back a group of UNK soldiers or to UNK in a UNK UNK He grew annoyed and at the same time surprised at that emotion. He was conscious of a growing sense of UNK UNK had written it all out, hadn't UNK Wasn't the report official UNK What did he hope to accomplish here? UNK had ordered him not to leave the far bank.

UNK get out of here. Watson ran up the ladder and stood for a second sucking in the cool air that smelled of mud and river UNK To his left, the two skiffs UNK their sharp UNK into the soft bank. The flat-bottomed boat swung slowly to the pull of the current. A soldier held the end of a UNK UNK Three Union guards appeared, carrying their rifles at UNK Watson stared at them UNK They were UNK men, well fed and UNK with neat uniforms and sturdy boots. Behind them UNK a long column of weak, UNK men. The thin gray figures raised a UNK UNK cry like the call of a bird UNK They moved toward the skiffs with shocking UNK UNK and UNK Four men were knocked down, but did not attempt to rise. They crept down the muddy slope toward the waiting boats. The Union soldiers grounded arms and settled into healthy, indifferent UNK to watch the feeble boarding of the UNK The crawling men tried to rise and fell again. No one moved to them. Watson watched two of them UNK into the shallow water and listened to their voices beg UNK In a confused, soaked and stumbling shift of bodies and lifting arms, the two men were dragged into the same skiff. The third crawling man forced himself UNK He swayed like a UNK his arms milling in slow circles. He paced forward UNK leaning too far back, his head tilted UNK His steps were short and UNK and, with his head thrown back, his progress was a UNK UNK He appeared to be peering UNK down his nose at the crowded and UNK vessel that would carry him to freedom. He stalked into the water and fell heavily over the side of the flat-bottomed UNK his weight nearly UNK the craft. Watson looked for the fourth man. He had reached the three passive UNK he crept in an UNK manner, UNK the ground before him. The guards did not look at him. The figure on the earth halted, seemingly UNK He sank back on his thin haunches like a weary UNK Then he began to crawl again. Watson watched the creeping figure. He felt a spectator interest. Would the man make it or not? If only there was a clock for him to crawl UNK If he failed to reach the UNK in five minutes, say, then the skiffs would pull away and leave him groping in the mud. Say three minutes to make it UNK Still the guards did not move, but stood UNK UNK from the UNK man. The figure halted, and Watson UNK The man began to creep in the wrong direction, deceived by a slight rise in the UNK He turned slowly and began to crawl back up the bank toward the UNK Watson raced for him, his boots UNK the soft earth. The guards came to life with astonishing UNK They spun and flung their rifles up. Watson UNK wildly. One man dropped to his knee for better aim. UNK me help him, for the love of UNK The guards lowered their rifles and their rifles and peered at Watson with UNK puzzled faces. Watson UNK to the crawling man and stopped, panting heavily. He reached down and closed his fingers on the man's upper arm. UNK his UNK a flat strip of muscle surged on the bone. Watson bent UNK and lifted the man to his feet. Watson stared into a UNK face. Two UNK balls the color of UNK rolled between fiery UNK Light sticks of fingers, the tips UNK with dark earth, patted at Watson's throat. The man's voice was a sweet, patient whisper. UNK said that he'd take my arm and get me right there. But you ain't UNK UNK UNK don't matter. Is it UNK How far could it be, Watson thought UNK how far can a blind man UNK Another body length or all the rest of his UNK life? UNK far. UNK talk deep. Not like us UNK It raises the voice, UNK in camp. You UNK UNK Come on, now. Can you UNK UNK course I can. I can walk real good. Watson stumbled down the bank. The man leaned his frail body against Watson's shoulder. He was no heavier than a child. Watson paused for breath. The man UNK UNK his UNK breath beating softly against Watson's neck. His sweet whisper came after great effort. UNK Christ **h. I wish you was Henry **h. He promised to take me. UNK UNK almost there. Watson supported the man to the edge of the bank and passed the frail figure over the bow of the nearest skiff. The man swayed on a UNK turning his ruined eyes from side to side. Watson turned away, UNK for the first time in many months. He heard the patient voice UNK UNK Where are you, UNK UNK him lie UNK Watson snatched a deep breath. He had not meant to UNK He stood with his back to the skiff. The men UNK and UNK begging to be taken away. Watson spoke UNK to the dark night UNK with UNK UNK UNK UNK What do you do to UNK UNK UNK at him UNK He was angry, UNK He had not felt that during the afternoon. No, nor later.

Men were UNK every day, tumbled into eternity like so many torn UNK flung down a portable UNK What made him think John had a right to witness his brother's UNK What right had John to any special UNK Was John better, more UNK To hell with John. Let him UNK with impatience to see UNK UNK open the note with trembling hands and read the formal report in UNK beautiful, UNK hand. John would UNK He believed that brave boys didn't cry. Watson UNK on the ground. He was grimly satisfied. He had UNK thought himself compelled to ease his brother's pain. Now he knew perfectly that he had but longed to increase his own UNK I WOULD not want to be one of those writers who begin each morning by UNK "O UNK O UNK O UNK and Dickens, what would you have made of a bomb shelter ornamented with four UNK UNK a UNK and three composition UNK with long UNK and red UNK As I say, I wouldn't want to begin a day like this, but I often wonder what the dead would have done. But the shelter is as much a part of my landscape as the UNK and UNK trees that grow on the UNK I can see it from this window where I write. It was built by the UNK and stands on the acre of ground that UNK our property. It UNK under a veil of thin, new grass, like some embarrassing fact of UNK and I think Mrs& Pastern set out the UNK to soften its meaning. It would have been like her. She was a pale woman. UNK on her UNK sitting in her UNK sitting anywhere, she ground an UNK of UNK UNK her a cup of tea and she would say, "Why, these cups look just like a set I gave to the Salvation Army last year".

He was marching up and down the UNK room of the UNK UNK Golf Club shouting, UNK UNK UNK UNK Let's throw a little nuclear hardware at them and show them who's UNK He was brigadier of the club's UNK light infantry, and at one time or another declared war on Russia, UNK UNK and China. It all began on an autumn UNK and who, after all these centuries, can describe the UNK of an autumn UNK One might pretend never to have seen one before, or, to more purpose, that there would never be another like it. The clear and searching sweep of sun on the UNK was like a climax of the year's UNK UNK were burning somewhere and the smoke UNK for all its UNK UNK of UNK The UNK blue air was stretched over the UNK like the skin of a UNK UNK her house one late afternoon, Mrs& Pastern stopped to admire the October light. It was the day to canvass for infectious UNK Mrs& Pastern had been given sixteen names, a bundle of literature, and a printed book of receipts. It was her work to go among her neighbors and collect their UNK Her house stood on a rise of ground, and before she got into her car she looked at the houses below. UNK as she knew it was complex and UNK and almost every roof she saw UNK UNK Mrs& UNK worked for the brain. Mrs& Ten UNK did mental health. Mrs& UNK worked for the UNK Mrs& Horowitz was in charge of diseases of the nose and throat. Mrs& UNK was tuberculosis, Mrs& UNK was UNK March of UNK Mrs& UNK was cancer, and Mrs& UNK did the UNK Mrs& UNK led the UNK league, Mrs& UNK was UNK and way in the distance could be seen the UNK roof of Ethel UNK house, a roof that UNK UNK Mrs& Pastern undertook the work of going from house to house with the UNK resignation of an honest and traditional UNK It was her UNK it was her life. Her mother had done it before her, and even her old UNK who had collected money for UNK and unwed mothers. Mrs& Pastern had telephoned most of her neighbors in UNK and most of them were ready for her. She experienced none of the UNK of some poor stranger selling UNK Here and there she stayed to visit and drink a glass of UNK The contributions were ahead of what she had got the previous year, and while the money, of course, was not UNK it excited her to stuff her UNK with big UNK She stopped at the UNK after dusk, and had a UNK She stayed too late, and when she left, it was dark and time to go home and cook supper for her husband.

"Nobody does, but they gave me ten last year". He was tired, he had his business UNK and the sight of his wife arranging pork UNK in the UNK only seemed like an extension of a boring day. He was happy enough to take the convertible and race up the hill to the UNK thinking that they might give him a drink. But the UNK were away; their maid gave him an envelope with a check in it and shut the door. Turning in at the UNK UNK he tried to remember if he had ever met them. The name encouraged him, because he always felt that he could UNK the Irish. There was a glass UNK in the front door, and through this he could see into a UNK where a UNK woman with red hair was arranging flowers. UNK UNK he shouted UNK She took a good look at herself in the mirror before she turned and, walking with very small steps, started toward the door. "Oh, please come UNK she said. The girlish voice was nearly a whisper. She was not a girl, he could see. Her hair was UNK and her bloom was UNK and she must have been crowding UNK but she seemed to be one of those women who cling to the manners and graces of a pretty child of eight. "Your wife just UNK she said, separating one word from another, exactly like a child.
